  *[[Dalada Uplands]] (Find, defeat and talk to [[Siege Devourer (npc)|Siege Devourer]])
  *[[Sacnoth Valley]] (Find, defeat and talk to [[Siege Devourer (npc)|Siege Devourer]])
  
  == Notes ==
  *To receive this form, you have to find a hostile [[Siege Devourer (npc)|Siege Devourer]] and reduce its health under 20%. The Siege Devourer will turn neutral to players, and the [[Charr Bladestorm]] riding it will dismount to attack players. Once neutral, a character can Mount the Siege Devourer by talking to it. The Siege Devourer will use the [[Mount]] skill with the character that talked to it. Once the Mount skill successfully activates, the character will be under this form.
  *This Form will be kept when zoning between the three [[Charr Homelands]] explorable areas. This does not happen if you go into a dungeon or town/outpost.
  *There are two spawn points where Siege Devourers can be found. One can be found in the [[Dalada Uplands]], the other in [[Grothmar Wardowns]]. 
  *While in Siege Devourer Form, your max health is fixed to 1000, max energy energy to 25, and your skills are replaced with the siege devourer skills:
  {{skill bar|Devourer Siege|Devourer Bite|Siege Devourer Swipe|Siege Devourer Feast|HYAHHHHH!|Blank|Blank|Dismount Siege Devourer}}
  *The normal attacks dealt while in this form will be always armor ignoring typeless damage. The damage and special properties of the attack will vary as follows:
  **Sword, Axe and Hammer: Melee, 55 damage.
  **Dagger: Melee, 40 damage. May deal double attacks.
  **Scythe: Melee, 35 damage. May hit a second foe if it is adjacent to target foe.
  **Bow, Staff, Wand: Ranged, 40 damage. Range and attack speed depends on weapon.
  **Spear: Ranged, 55 damage. Same range as spear.
  *While in this form, if you health goes to 0, the Siege Devourer will die instead of you, the Form will end and you will appear next to the dead Corpse of the Siege devourer, with full health and energy. If you want to keep the siege devourer alive, you have to Dismount before that happens.
  *If you resign while mounted, the Siege Devourer completely disappears & is replaced by your dead body.
  *Siege Devourer models respond to some emote commands:
  **/dance : The Siege Devourer jumps and starts side-walking left and right, clapping its pincers.
  * The siege devourer form and the way of acquiring it (killing the Charr controlling it) may be a tribute to the [[W:Scorpion tank|Scorpion tank]] from the popular Halo game series
  
  ===Tactics===
  *While controlling the devourer you may notice that it gets exhausted easily.  Timing your attacks or at least reserving your attacks for when you have the energy helps with this.  If you get it right you can avoid being completely exhausted in this form, but it isn't easy.  For the most part targeting a single target in a group works much like that of meteor shower, but to a slightly larger area and only once per shot.
  *With 2 siege devourers in the group things can get interesting and farming reputation points becomes much easier.  One thing to note is that both devourers can safely target enemies attacking the other in the group.  That is to say 1 devourer can target a foe attacking the other devourer without doing [[AoE]] damage to their teammate.  Knowing this helps out quite a bit since it means that teammates can back each other up.
  *You might notice that while using both devourers you can alternate attacks, helping the other conserve energy.  Since you can also save the devourer by dismounting before it dies it will remain where you left it if you die and get resurrected some distance away.  You can benefit from this since you will not be affected by the death penalty gained when you die while you are controlling the devourer.  They do die easily though so be careful when using them.

  #Including the boss.\n\
  *Talking to Asura at [[Resurrection Shrine]]s while under the ''Asuran Bodyguard'' will either upgrade ''Asuran Bodyguard'' to the next rank or grant bonus reputation points:\n\
  :*25-49 kills - 20 reputation points\n\
  :*50-74 kills - 40 reputation points\n\
  :*100-149 kills - 60 reputation points\n\
  :*150+ kills - 100 reputation points\n\
  *Tip: The ''Rampager Hunt'' allows for double points towards this title by killing one enemy under 45 seconds. The bonus itself is not stackable, but combinations with other bonuses are possible. Example:\n\
  :* Asuran Bodyguard Rank 2 (1+2) + 1x ''Rampager Hunt'' bonus: 6 points/kill\n\
  :* Asuran Bodyguard Rank 2 (1+2) + 2x ''Rampager Hunt'' bonus: 6 points/kill\n\
  :* Asuran Bodyguard Rank 2 (1+2) + 1x ''Rampager Hunt'' bonus + ''10 points/kill in 60 seconds'' bonus: 26 points/kill\n\
  *Tip: Do not rush to get bonuses from shrines. Collect them after killing each and every mob in the area. That way you will collect from 200 up to 500 points.\n\
  *Getting rank 2 triples your reputation gain per kill in NM and doubles it in HM.\n\n\

  ==Notes==
  *This buff grants players a base Health of 480 and bonuses to their attributes, and replaces their current armor level with the max armor level for that class until they reach level 20. 
  *This buff sets one attribute to rank 12 and three additional attributes to rank 9. The effect overrides the player's current ranks in all attributes and places 12 ranks in the attribute of the weapon the player is wielding, 9 ranks in that player's primary attribute, 9 ranks based on the attribute of the focus or shield the player is wearing (if applicable), and 9 ranks based on the skills on the player's Skill Bar until the player has three attributes with 9 ranks in them.
  *If the attribute of the weapon the player is wielding isn't available to that player, no attribute will be set to 12 and instead you will get four attributes with 9 points in each.
  *Upon reaching level 20, this buff goes away the next time that player enters a new zone. 
  *Any runes on your armor which boost attributes are nullified. No part of the rune works, that is, you won't get -75 health for a superior rune which isn't actually doing anything.
  *Skills which boost your attributes, such as [[Glyph of Elemental Power]], [[Elemental Lord]], [[Awaken the Blood]] no longer function correctly when this buff is applied.
  *Heroes are not affected by this buff.
  *[[Weakness]] does not reduce your attributes when you are buffed by this.

Dishonorable: |-

You are considered Dishonorable because teammates repeatedly reported you for leeching, or because you repeatedly abandoned your team in [[Random Arenas]], [[Alliance Battles]], or [[Competitive Mission]]s. You may not participate in [[PvP]] until this effect expires.
  }}
  == Notes ==
  * [[Dishonorable]] is the effect of accumulating ten or more dishonor points on a player and lasts one minute for each dishonor point that player has. 
  * Although this effect can only be bestowed while playing in Random Arenas, Alliance Battles or Competitive Missions, it prevents you from attending '''any''' PvP mission, including [[Heroes' Ascent]], [[Team Arenas]], [[Hero Battles]] and [[Guild Battle]]s
  * Another way to obtain [[Dishonorable]] is by resigning twice from [[Rollerbeetle Races]]. Resigning can also mean being kicked off the server due to lag.
  * Players that have this effect are noticed due to the [[hex]]'s distinctive purple downwards arrow on the health bar. This hex is only displayed in PvP outposts, and is currently the only hex in the game that is displayed while you are in a [[town]] or [[outpost]].
  * Unlike most hexes, the dark ring does not appear near the lower section of a character.
  * This effect was added as part of the [[Dishonorable Combatant System]] ([[Game updates/20070927|September, 27, 2007]].)
  * There is no way to see how many dishonor points you have accumulated.
