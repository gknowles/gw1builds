  Splinter Mines are part of the environment in the [[Elona Reach]] mission.  They have the appearance of a shriveled plant and react when party members approach. A glowing circle similar to a [[ward]] will appear, and after 5 seconds, [[Splinter Mine (skill)|Splinter Mine]] skill will be activated, inflicting [[Crippling]] and [[Bleeding]] on every creature within the circle, both ally and foe. The Splinter Mine will continue activating the effect every 3 seconds, until anyone uses it, removing the core. 
  Once the Splinter Mine is used, the Splinter Mine will trigger the effect for a last time, so anyone getting it should get of of the area, and the player will get a [[Splinter Mine (bundle)|Splinter Mine]] [[bundle]] item, which, once dropped, will activate the [[Splinter Mine (skill)|Splinter Mine]] skill once against foes only in the player's location after 3 seconds aproximately.

  | profession = rt\n\
  | service = Hero\n\
  | level = 20\n\
  | campaign = Nightfall\n\
  }}\n\
  [[Razah]] is a [[ritualist]] [[hero]] and is a creature made out of [[the Mists]]. It was created with an unknown purpose, and the nature of its origin is more akin to [[demon]]s than the [[human]] form that it takes.\n\n\
  From the manual:\n\
  :'''Origin:''' [[The Mists]]\n\
  :'''Age:''' Inapplicable\n\
  :'''Profession:''' Ritualist\n\n\
  :''Unformed hero''\n\
  :''\"I live to serve.\"''\n\n\
  :''The protomatter that makes up the Mists strains toward creation, often spawning demonic creations in nightmarish forms. Not all creatures from the Mists are demonic, however. When the Mists come into contact with a suitable human template, for example, it can copy that form, creating a sentient entity with humanoid appearance and an almost human mind.''\n\n\
  :''Razah is one such creation. It has sprung into being a fully-formed adult. It has the knowledge and capabilities of a human, but lacks common sense. As a result, it asks odd questions about human emotions, contemplates human motivations, and attempts to duplicate human mannerisms. Razah is a contradiction: more than human in some ways, and less than human in others. It needs an identity, a personality, and a purpose. Hopefully, Razah will find its purpose by working with a hero. Otherwise, it could degenerate into an abomination as monstrous and inhuman as its demonic brethren.''\n\n\
  ==Locations==\n\
  *[[Realm of Torment]]\n\
  **{{NPC location|Heart of Abaddon}} (prior to completing the quest [[Finding a Purpose]])\n\n\
  ==Quests==\n\
  '''Quests involved in:'''\n\
  *[[Finding a Purpose]]\n\n\
  ==Recruitment==\n\
  [[Image:RazahUnlocked.jpg|right]]\n\
  Complete the quest [[Finding a Purpose]], offered by [[Chaplain Phyratyss]] in the [[Gate of Anguish]]. Your character must have completed the [[Nightfall]] campaign.\n\n\

  *{{skill icon|Warmonger's Weapon}} \n\
  *{{skill icon|Wielder's Boon}}\n\
  *{{skill icon|Wielder's Strike}} \n\n\
  ==Armor==\n\
  Razah starts with Mysterious armor at an [[armor rating]] of 60. Its armor sets are unique compared to other heroes in that the headgear is visible. Razah's default weapon is a max 9 req [[Spawning Staff]] with damage +15% while Health is above 50%.\n\n\
  The appearance of its armor can be upgraded to [[Primeval armor]] using [[Primeval Armor Remnants]] acquired in the [[Domain of Anguish]] and during [[the Ebony Citadel of Mallyx]] mission.\n\n\
  ==Dialogue==\n\
  '''In the Heart of Abaddon:'''\n\n\
  :''\"You are not from this place. Who and what are you?\"''\n\n\
  '''Idle Quotes:'''\n\n\
  :''\"Destruction seems a natural part of the human condition.\"''\n\
  :''\"Human rituals seem to involve a great deal of talking, and dancing, and making speeches. This much I have seen... but I do not understand.\"''\n\
  :''\"I have learned this much: In all of human existance, there are many kinds of life... and many kinds of death.\"''\n\
  :''\"If I learn to cry, it will not be for me. It will not be for Istan. It will be for the gods themselves, who cannot be a part of the very thing they created.\"''\n\
  :''\"Tell me, are all humans as obsessed with yelling and bludgeoning things, or are you an unusual representative of your species?\"''\n\n\
  '''Battle Quotes:'''\n\n\
  :''\"Ah! I begin to understand pain! Thank you!\"''\n\
  :''\"I barely touched him... and he broke. You humans are so fragile!\"''\n\
  :''\"I cannot understand why you shout such things.\"''\n\
  :''\"These people are my friends. I will not allow you to hurt them.\"''\n\
  :''\"We rise and fall together.\"''\n\
  :''\"What a waste, to understand life, and yet throw it away for such a trite cause.\"''\n\
  :''\"You are not ready for immortality.\"''\n\n\
  ==Notes==\n\
  *A duplicate Razah will show up as a \"Ritualist Entity\".\n\
  *Razah does not have gender. It was created, not born. As such, its species also remains unknown.\n\
  *Razah does not transfer [[disease]] to party members.\n\n\
  ==Trivia==\n\
  *Razah's profession is listed as \"variable\" in the Nightfall manual. This was printed before the final design was decided upon.\n\
  *Razah is currently the only Hero with visible headgear.\n\
  *An official screenshot ([http://www.guildwars.com/gallery/screenshots/nightfall/gwn-scr073.php]) shows Razah in an unnamed armor set that does not appear to be implemented in the game. No such armor could be obtained from the [[Gate of Anguish]] or in any one of the [[Challenge Mission]]s.\n\
  *Razah's personality and account is very similar to the character ''Data'', from the TV series ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_trek Star Trek]''.\n\
  *Razah's \"You are not ready for immortality.\" line is a Kosh quote from an episode of Babylon 5.\n\n\

  | campaign = Prophecies
  | region = Southern Shiverpeaks
  | type = Cooperative
  | duration = Long
  | preceded by = [[Iron Mines of Moladune (mission)]]
  | followed by = [[Final Blow]]
  }}
  The Deldrimor dwarves have lost the Keep, and they need your help to retake it from the Stone Summit and defend it against the Mursaat.
  
  ==Objectives==
  Retake Thunderhead Keep.
  *Clear the city. 
  *Clear the fort. 
  *Kill Dagnar Stonepate. 
  *'''Added''': Help King Jalis Ironhammer hold Thunderhead Keep. 
  *'''Bonus''': Light the beacons to draw additional Mursaat forces into Thunderhead Keep. 
  *King Jalis Ironhammer must survive.
  
  ==Skill recommendations==
  *Depending on the approach taken during the final siege, speed enhancements such as [["Charge!"]] may be very useful. Likewise, a ranger equipped with [[trap]]s or a Ritualist with attacking spirits such as [[Pain]] and [[Bloodsong]] may help during the siege.
  *Randomly, you will face [[Demetrios the Enduring]] during the final seige. If unprepared to deal out sufficient damage, the mission may end in a stalemate. Someone in the party should take skills to mitigate or interrupt Demetrios's healing to prevent this. 
  *Necromancer [[well]]s may be helpful to deny [[Stone Summit Gnasher]]s of their minions, but they will be of limited use against the non-fleshy Jade.
  
  ==Party==
  A party consisting out of two monks, two tanks, two nukers and two interrupters should be able to complete the mission without any problems. Make sure you can split up your party into two balanced teams if you choose for the strategy 'defend the gates'.
  
  ==Walkthrough==
  This mission is a trial of teamwork. Before the mission even begins, players should agree on who will lead [[King Jalis Ironhammer]] and how they plan to defend the fort during the final siege. Designate a target caller and decide if you will be attempting the bonus.
  
  ===Getting to the Fort===
  When the mission starts, you'll see King Jalis in front of you. He will follow whoever talks to him first, so if you have a designated babysitter, wait until that player speaks with the king. Outside the doors, defeat the [[Summit Giant Herder]]s in front of you. Then work your way around the back of the hill with [[Siege Ice Golem]]s and defeat them too. [[Avicara]] occupy the rest of the western edge here, but you do not need to fight them. Instead, proceed down the bridge guarded by [[Stone Summit]]. Towards the end of the bridge is another group. It's safest to pull them onto the bridge to fight, as another group of Stone Summit squad containing a boss patrols up to the bridge. You will need to defeat this patrol as well and proceed across the ridge. You should be looking down at the gates of the city with only a few rangers and [[Enslaved Frost Giant]]s defending.
  
  Once in the city, the eight groups of Stone Summit will periodically ping on the compass. You will need to defeat them all to continue. A typical path involves starting up the left path along the city wall, then crossing the center via a gully, avoiding the boss's group, then circling up and around to the boss's group. You will also notice a pair of outcroppings stationed by rangers and giants. While they rarely can hit you, you may kill them now to ease the difficulty later. The leftmost group is easiest to kill with skills that don't require line of sight, while the group on the right can be hit with bows from the ledge next to the gate. When ready, lead the king to the gate and he will open it. After he opens the gate, he will follow the closest player to him.
  
  With the gates open, you'll be greeted by [[Stone Summit Heretic]]s and [[Stone Summit Gnasher|Gnasher]]s. If you did not kill the rangers and giants from inside the city, you will also have to fight them now. Follow the path towards the fort. The foes in the fort are dangerously close to each other, and it is very easy to accidentally aggro more then you planned, especially the Heretics in the center. Use a bow to draw them away from each other when possible. Before killing all the foes in the fort, you may want to use one of the ballistas on the western wall to take out a group of [[White Mantle]]. Four shots should kill the entire group. Once the fort has been cleared out, a cutscene with [[Vizier Khilbron]] ensues, the king takes his place at the top of the fort, and the siege begins.
  
  ===Defending the Fort===
  Waves of White Mantle and Mursaat will attack the fort from both the eastern and western gates and head towards the king. If the king dies, the mission is lost, so protect him at all cost. Both the eastern and western walls house a pair of ballistas that, when fired will hit one of the darkened areas on the map. Occasionally some of the attacking forces will stand in these areas and be killed before they enter the gates. Four shots will finish off any unit that doesn't heal. All enemy units spawn at a teleporter in the north.
  
  The siege consists of three phases. During the first phase, the waves consist of [[Stone Summit]] Dwarves and [[Enslaved Frost Giant]]s, and includes one of six [[elemental]] and Stone Summit Dwarf bosses. During the second phase, the waves consist of [[Mursaat]] and [[jade construct]]s, as well as one Mursaat or jade construct boss. During the third phase, the waves consist of [[White Mantle]] members, there is no boss during this wave, but the final wave is a large group including [[Confessor Dorian]].
  
  ====Defend the King====
  Perhaps the easiest method when using all heroes and henchmen is to stand at the top of the stairs where the king is. Regardless of which gate foes enter, they will always converge at the top of the stairs, thus it is difficult for any to slip by unhindered to the king. However, this means that the king is dangerously close to battle and will occasionally join in. He has a tendency to stop somewhere away from his normal post, so players must keep track to ensure he is not the first to gain aggro from an incoming wave. Also, uncoordinated groups may find players venturing into the courtyard to do battle, raising the chances of foes moving along the wall and killing the king. If foes are cleared quick enough, a player can often get a few shots off from the ballistas, but if the foes are not killed, they will heal by the time they reach the top of the stairs.
  
  ====Defend the Gates====
  By splitting into two groups, each taking one of the two gates, the attacking foes can be kept a safe distance from the king. The difficulty, of course, is the party is split. While some may run across the courtyard to assist the other side, you always want at least one player keeping an eye on both gates to ensure no enemies slip by to the unprotected king. Ballistas are more useful using this strategy, as foes may not fully heal by the time they reach the gates. Classes that do not need line of sight or trapper rangers should man the ballistas so they can move down the wall to assist foes that reach the gate. Trappers may place traps on the wall above the gate and they will still trigger against foes passing below.
  
  When bosses appear, especially the Mursaat boss, it may be difficult to deal enough damage to take it down (especially if it is the monk boss). In such case, leave him alone and kill everything else. Otherwise, the troops will build up and eventually overwhelm the defenders. When there is a lull on the other gate, players with speed boosts may rush over to attempt to take out the boss then rush back.
  
  ====Attack the Teleporter====
  If the party has sufficient power, it can push back the oncoming waves to the north where they spawn. They all must pass through a northern choke point, so if the players defend it, they can remain as a full party and keep the king a safe distance from battle. Any Jade along the way can be safely ignored, as they are part of the bonus and will not attack the king. Focus on getting everyone up to the choke point, making sure nothing that can't be killed by the Smoke Phantoms gets by.
  
  ===Bonus===
  <!-- Provide a walkthrough of what is required for the bonus -->
  After the cutscene marking the start of the seige, the two [[Storm Beacon]]s on the eastern and western walls must be lit to begin the bonus. This will redirect a couple small groups of Jade away from the dwarves calling for help and towards the fort. If the party delays too long in lighting the beacons, the dwarves will be killed, failing the bonus. You will know if the bonus failed if the dwarves cry out, ''The end is here! Great Dwarf save us!'' Credit for the bonus is not awarded until the end of the seige with the death of Confessor Dorian.
  
  The Jade that are redirected are not aligned with the remaining siege troops and will attack them. While they will enter the fort, they do not move up to the king, so you can hold back, letting them fight the first waves of the siege. Due to this, Thunderhead Keep is easier to complete with bonus than without.

  You've agreed to help the elemental [[Dehjah]] to remove the [[Drought]], a powerful demon, which has taken up residence in [[Waterworks]] of the [[The Floodplain of Mahnkelon]].  If left the Drought will corrupt the river Elon making it unusable for all those living in the area. 
  
  This mission represents a branch in the storyline which is determined by your choice of Master of Whispers or [[Magrid the Sly]].  If you have Margrid the Sly, you may return to this mission after completing [[Abaddon's Gate (Mission)|Abaddon's Gate]], or enter the mission with someone who has Master of Whispers. 
  
  ==Mission information==
  
  ===Requirements===
  Make sure that you have [[Master of Whispers]] in your party before entering the mission.  
  
  ===Objectives===
  Destroy the Drought.
  * '''Added''' Protect [[Dehjah]] until she opens the entrance to the [[Mahnkelon Waterworks]].
  * '''Added''' Make your way to the central reservoir.
  * '''Added''' Weaken [[the Drought]] by shutting off the water pumps.
  * '''Bonus''' Defeat the Drought without shutting down water pumps.
  
  ===Reward===
  Depends on the number of water pumps you had to switch off to defeat the Drought.
  {{Mission reward
  | objective = Pumps off
  | standard = 2 - 5
  | expert = 1
  | master = 0 }}
  
  ==Walkthrough==
  At the beginning of the mission you follow Dehjah as she leads the way to an entrance of the waterworks.  She seems to be in a hurry to get rid of the Drought, as she tends to run ahead into the [[Drake]]s before you're quite ready.  She can be overwhelmed if you don't keep up, so do your best to stick with her.  
  
  Dehjah leaves you at the entrance to the waterworks.  There is an [[environmental effect]] in this area, [[Thirst of the Drought]], which increases the damage you take from Earth damage by 50%.   This doesn't matter much until you get to the Drought itself who is an  [[elementalist]] boss specialising in [[Earth magic]], whose damage is fearsome enough without this assistance.  You can get rid of this effect by turning off each of the pumps in the waterworks, of which there are 5 in total.  Each pump gives a 2% [[morale boost]] and reduces the environment effect by 10% until there is no effect at all. 
  
  Travel to each pump indicated by the flags on the area map, killing anything which gets in your way. Switch off as many pumps as you feel is necessary as you make your way inwards to the Drought.
  
  The Drought is accompanied by two Droughtlings and there are several more groups of Droughtlings in the area.  Take care of any Droughling groups you think will get in the way first. Then utilise the skills recommended below when you take on the Drought and stay spread out watching for [[Sandstorm]].  Kill the Drought and the Droughtlings in it's group to finish the mission.
  
  ===Bonus===
  This bonus is one of the few where you end up doing less in the mission, rather than more, to achieve the bonus.  For the bonus take the most direct route to the Drought through any Kournan groups you come across.  Take a bit more care with the Drought and make sure you come well prepared.
  
  ===Skill recommendations===
  *Bring anti-spellcaster skills for the Drought and Droughtlings.  Examples would be skills which cause [[Daze]], spell [[interrupt]]s, [[shutdown]] or hexes which cause damage to spell casters and stop the AI from casting spells, like [[Backfire]].
  *[[Winter]] can be used to change the Drought's earth damage to [[Cold damage]], negating the [[Thirst of the Drought]] effect.
  *Skills which protect against [[Elemental damage]], or more specifically [[Earth damage]] are useful.
  *Damage reduction is important, so skills such as [[Protective Spirit]] and [[Shelter]] are good.
  *A bonder monk can be handy in the end since you only take physical dmg. there

  [[Image:Disambig icon.png|30px]]''This is a [[mission]] entry. For information on the [[mission outpost]]s, see [[Vizunah Square (Foreign Quarter)]] and [[Vizunah Square (Local Quarter)]]''

  In this mission a team of characters from outside [[Cantha]] accompanied by [[Mhenlo]] meet with a team of Canthan native characters with [[Master Togo]]. Together the teams fight through droves of [[Afflicted|afflicted]] to find the source of the plague in Kaineng City.
  
  ==Mission information==
  
  ===Objectives===
  Locate the source of the plague in Kaineng City
  * Mhenlo must survive
  * Master Togo must survive

  | hardmstr = < 35}}
  
  ==Walkthrough==
  Both teams start at separate locations. While the Canthan team together with Master Togo is immediately faced with spawning afflicted, the Tyrian team with Mhenlo has to fight several groups of (easier) human enemies first to make their way to the meet up point. Since Togo has to be kept alive, a common reason to fail the mission is for the Canthan team to get overwhelmed and lose Togo before the Tyrian reinforcements arrive. To prevent this, the Canthan team should place more emphasis on healing compared to the Tyrian one. Once the two groups meet, healers from both teams are able to heal both NPCs.
  
  After the first battle, the mission follows a straight forward path, including two big fights at afflicted spawning points. During those fights multiple waves of afflicted spawn (and respawn) from three separate points. The [[Afflicted Soul Explosion]] can overwhelm parties in these situations. Spread apart and try to intercept the spawns with three "mini-parties" instead of fighting them all in one big melee.
  
  ''Note that while you can heal members of the other group, you can not resurrect them. Each party has to provide for their own means of resurrection.''
  
  ===Skill recommendations===
  In this mission, a total of 16 characters plus Master Togo and Brother Mhenlo will fight on your side. Compared with the normal 8 character party, all skills that affect [[allies]] or an area scale especially well. [[Elementalist]]s' [[ward]]s and [[Ritualist]]s' healing [[Binding Ritual|spirits]], but also [[shout]]s and [[chant]]s provide great value since they affect the other group as well. Furthermore, the fighting is tight and packed. [[AoE]] damage of all forms will be of great use. Finally, there is an abundance of corpses, making the mission a [[Minion Master]]'s paradise, and each group should think about bringing one. There are usually enough corpses to support 3 or 4 MMs, and as every MMs [[Blood of the Master]] heals minions of others too the minions have improved survivability. Warriors should also consider bringing [["I Will Avenge You!"]] as the NPCs killed throughout the mission will trigger its effects, providing an almost continuous buff.

A Land of Heroes: "{{Quest infobox\n\
  | name = A Land of Heroes\n\
  | map = [[Image:A Land of Heroes map.jpg|250px]]\n\
  | campaign = Nightfall\n\
  | region = Istan\n\
  | type = Primary\n\
  | given by = [[Quarrymaster Bohanna]]\n\
  | given at = [[Champion's Dawn]]\n\
  | preceded by = [[Securing Champion's Dawn]]\n\
  | followed by = [[The Time is Nigh]]\n\
  }}\n\
  A Land of Heroes asks you to defend [[Champion's Dawn]] from an onslaught of [[Corsair]]s and [[Kournan]]s. Then in the [[Cliffs of Dohjok]] destroy six of their camps in the southern area of the [[Cliffs of Dohjok]].  This [[quest]] is a mini-mission, if your party fails then you will be returned to [[Champion's Dawn]] and must restart the quest again. \n\n\
  Afterwards, you will be transported to the [[Sunspear Great Hall]].\n\n\
  ==Quest information==\n\
  ===Requirements===\n\
  *Finish [[Securing Champion's Dawn]]\n\
  *Only available to non-Elonian characters.\n\n\
  ===Objectives===\n\
  * Champion's Dawn must not fall to the corsairs.\n\
  * Speak to [[Quarrymaster Bohanna]] when all members of your party are ready to defend [[Champion's Dawn]]\n\
  * Hold off the initial assault against [[Champion's Dawn]]\n\
  * [[Kormir]] must survive.\n\
  * Your party is engaged in a mini-mission.  If your party dies during this quest you will not be resurrected at a [[resurrection shrine]].\n\
  Added later on:\n\
  * Seize the corsair landing points.\n\
  Added still later on:\n\
  * Destroy the corsair chain of command by striking back at their war camps.\n\n\
  ===Reward===\n\
  * 2,500 [[Experience]]\n\
  * 300 [[Sunspear Promotion Points]]\n\n\
  ==Walkthrough==\n\
  The first part of the quest requires your party to defend against around 6 corsair and kournan groups.  Each group contains a random set of profession with 3 or 4 members.  They come from two different sides, one from the west and the other from the southwest towards the beaches.  Each group comes individually.  At the end of the sequence the final group will contain a level 18 boss.\n\n\
  Afterwards, your party will move southwest to the beach of the [[Cliffs of Dohjok]].  There will be six points your party needs to take control of.  Each location will have two or three groups of corsairs and kournans.  Wait for each enemy group to move away from the landing points and then pull them towards you.  Two of the landing points will have a level 18 or 20 boss of different professions.  \n\n\
  After the landing points are taken your party will be tasked with taking out two corsair camps in the quarry.  Each camp contains 3 corsair groups of about 3 each.  Additionally, each camp will have a single boss.  Once again, separate the groups and pull them back to your party.  After both camps have been taken the mini-mission will end and a timer will count down from 30 seconds and return your party to [[Champion's Dawn]].\n\n\
  ==Dialogue==\n\n\
  ===Initial dialogue===\n\
  '''Quarrymaster Bohanna'''\n\
  :''\"I have lost a lot of good men between the travesty of Fahranur and various monster queen attacks on the quarry, so I can offer little in the way of assistance.  What men I do have are attacking the main corsair camps to the west.  With luck, they can keep them busy while you push your forces forward from the east.  At least, that's how [[Kormir]] explained it to me.  She is waiting for you on the [[Cliffs of Dohjok]].  Are you ready to defend [[Champion's Dawn]]?\"''\n\
  :'''Accept:''' ''\"We shouldn't keep her waiting any longer.\"''\n\
  :'''Decline:''' ''\"What? I thought she brough me here for a vacation!\"''\n\n\
  :'''When asked about quest:''' ''\"Your entire party will leave this outpost and be taken to the front line in the battle against the attacking corsair army.  Are you ready to defend [[Champion's Dawn]]?\"''\n\
  :'''Accept:''' ''\"Ready as ever!\"''\n\
  :'''Decline:''' ''Not quite yet...\"''\n\n\
  ===Intermediate dialogue===\n\
  [[Kormir]]'s welcome dialogue:\n\
  :'''Kormir:''' ''\"Prepare yourselves! We are all that stand between Istan and destruction!\"''\n\n\
  During the corsair and kournan assault:\n\
  :'''Kormir''': ''\"Do you see the armored troops among the corsairs?  They are [[Warmarshal Varesh]]'s [[Kournan]] [[warrior]]s.  They did not expect to see such heroes from foreign lands as yourselves.\"''\n\n\
  After the corsair and kournan assault:\n\
  :'''Kormir:''' ''\"Quickly!  Make your way to the water's edge and seize the corsair landing points.  Slay any corsairs and Kournans you encounter.\"''\n\n\
  After taking the first landing point:\n\
  :'''Kormir:''' ''\"The three provinces of Elona...Kourna, Istan, and Vabbi...have long known peace and prosperity.  The Kournans came to Istan under the banner of friendship.\"''\n\n\
  After taking the second landing point:\n\
  :'''Kormir:''' ''[[Varesh Ossa]]'s treacherous dealings with the corsairs are the least of her crims.  She has dabbled with dark, inhuman forces and sought forbidden knowledge.  One of Varesh's generals unleashed a great evil within the ruins of the First City of [[Fahranur]].  I believe she is trafficking with great, malevolent powers.  Should she succeed, night will most surely fall upon Elona.''\n\n\
  After taking the third landing point:\n\
  :'''Kormir:''' ''\"Varesh's plans threaten not only Elona, but the entire world.  Her actions are causing ruptures to appear across the realms, from which fell creatures emerge.\"''\n\
  :'''<Party Leader's Name>:''' ''\"You mean the demons that invaded our cities and attacked our homelands?\"''\n\
  :'''Kormir:''' ''\"Indeed.  That is the fate Varesh Ossa has planned for the world.  First we must defeat her allies.  Then we must take the battle to Kourna.\"''\n\n\
  Approaching the corsair camps:\n\
  :'''Kormir:''' ''\"All that remain now are the corsair camps.  Once we have dealt with these corsairs, we can deal with Varesh herself, in Gandara!\"''\n\n\
  ===Reward dialogue===\n\
  :''\"Well done, <name>!  From the sound of it, those corsairs won't be coming back any time soon.  Now, if you still wish to help our cause, the Sunspears could certainly use your leadership skills in the assault on Gandara.  You would do well by helping Kormir raise troop morale before the coming battle.\"''\n\n\
  ==Notes==\n\
  * This quest is designed for characters transferring from Prophecies or Factions.\n\
  * This quest was added to the game on 20 December 2006.\n\
  * If you have fewer than 1,000 Sunspear points you will receive a bounty of double XP and 4 Sunspear points for each corsair or Kournan kill.\n\
  * The mini-mission format of this quest means that it offers several elite skill captures. These are not otherwise available until later in the game, so even Elonian characters may wish to join a party doing this quest:\n\

  {{Quest infobox\n\
  | name = The Accursed Path\n\
  | campaign = Prophecies\n\
  | region = Ascalon (pre-Searing)\n\
  | type = Secondary\n\
  | given by = [[Oberan the Reviled]] \n\
  | given at = [[The Catacombs]]}}\n\n\
  [[Oberan the Reviled]] will ask you to kill 5 level 3 [[Crypt Fiends]]. They will come one at a time along the corridor.<br>\n\n\
  ==Quest information==\n\
  ===Requirements===\n\
  * Must be a [[Necromancer]]\n\n\
  ===Objectives===\n\
  * Go south and destroy the crypt fiends.\n\
  * Return to Oberan the Reviled for your reward.\n\n\
  ===Reward===\n\
  * 500 [[Experience]]\n\
  * {{skill icon|Faintheartedness}}\n\
  * {{skill icon|Soul Barbs}}\n\n\
  ==Walkthrough==\n\
  This quest is pretty straightforward. Just kill the crypt fiends and get your reward. You can use Faintedheartedness and Life Siphon to inflict heavy degenerative damage. And if you cast Soul Barbs before that, both hexes will cause damage when casted on them.\n\n\
  Note that Oberan can be hard to find for new players. It is a good idea to acquire the quest [[Charr in the Catacombs]] from [[Prince Rurik]] as it will lead the player straight to Oberan.\n\n\
  ==Dialogue==\n\n\
  ===Initial dialogue===\n\
  '''Oberan the Reviled'''\n\
  :''\"Working here in the catacombs protects me from the prying eyes of the living, but my necromantic experiments have begun to attract the attention of creatures from beyond the pale. I'd like to continue my work without interruption by these infernal beasts\"''\n\n\
  :''\"If you go south and eliminate the crypt fiends that have been bothering me, I will share with you a few of my most essential [[Curses]]. Then you too will see that the true power in the Necromancer's art lies not merely in the manipulation of the dead.\" ''\n\
  :'''Accept:''' ''\"Consider it a bargain.\"''\n\
  :'''Decline:''' ''\"I'm not sure I can handle this.\"''\n\
  :'''When asked about quest:''' ''\"Don't squander the power I have placed at your fingertips! The crypt fiends are not far from here. The demons cannot help but be drawn to the dark forces I command.\"''\n\n\
  ===Reward dialogue===\n\
  '''Oberan the Reviled'''\n\
  :''\"Excellent. I shall be glad to be rid of those fiends. You show promise in the art of necromancy.\"''"

  Pikin is both the only [[hero skill trainer]] to teach six skills for a profession instead of the usual five, and to teach the same skill as another [[hero skill trainer]] ([[Shatter Enchantment]]). Thus, it is likely that Pikin's teaching of [[Shatter Enchantment]] is unintended.

  The son of a huntsman, [[Aidan]] grew up with a quiver of arrows on his back. His mother died giving birth to him while his family was on a wagon train from [[Kryta]] to [[Ascalon]]. As soon as the boy was old enough to hold a bow in one hand, Aidan\xE2\x80\x99s father packed up just the good steel heads of their tools and the two men headed off into the wild. They found a spot in the middle of a forest clearing, refitted their tools with hand-carved handles, and built their own home from scratch. \n\n\
  Aidan is a survivor. Nothing is out of the question if it means he and his companions will live for another day. He thinks fast and acts even faster. His inner calm\xE2\x80\x94a sort of simple confidence\xE2\x80\x94has a way of infecting everyone around him. Being the oldest member of the party, he has the wisdom of years his younger counterparts lack, though he never feels the need to lord it over them. He does feel a certain amount of responsibility to keep the group informed and out of trouble if at all possible. From time to time, he takes on the role of group patriarch, but only if there is a meltdown and he sees the need for his cooler head to prevail. He is one of the [[Heroes of Ascalon]]\n\n\

  ==Walkthrough==\n\
  Although the task is unpleasant, the quest is pretty straightforward.  You can simply map to Ascalon City and exit.  Melka will be right outside.\n\n\
  ==Dialogue==\n\n\
  ===Initial dialogue===\n\
  '''Grazden the Protector'''\n\
  :''\"I have one last thing to ask of you, although it is not a pleasant duty.  Paulus had only one person he was very close with, a woman named '''Melka Blanston'''.  They were often seen together just outside Ascalon City.  If you could take her news of Paulus's death, I'd be grateful.  She deserves to hear of it from the one who found him.  Take his '''holy symbol''' to her as well, so that it might offer her some amount of comfort.  This is the most unpleasant job that we Monks have, and it is becoming a disturbingly frequent one.  Still, someone must perform this unpleasant task.\n\n\
  :''What say you?\"''\n\
  :'''Accept:''' ''\"I will speak with Melka.\"''\n\
  :'''Decline:''' ''\"This sounds too unpleasant.\"''\n\
  :'''When asked about quest:''' ''\"I know it is a difficult thing, but '''Melka''' must be informed of Paulus's death.  She waits just outside of Ascalon City.\"''\n\n\
  ===Reward dialogue===\n\
  '''Melka Blanston'''\n\
  :''\"What's this?  Paulus's holy symbol?  Then that means...he's gone...Paulus would often offer me some comfort after my husband went off to fight the Charr.  Now who will I turn to?  The gods are cruel to steal everything that I love away from me.  I want to thank you for delivering this to me, but please just...just leave me to my grief.\"''\n\n\

  The objective in the quest log for this quest is bugged.  It is actually the objective for the quest [[Deliver a Message to My Wife]], another quest involving Melka."

  ==The Phoenix, the representation of fiery eternity in the Underworld==
  
  ''Hai Jii was the youngest of eight sons from a noble family long known for producing talented Warriors. He did not like to fight, preferring to wield his paintbrush with which he had unsurpassed skill. One evening, his family was attacked by a neighboring warlord. Hai Jii was tortured and left for dead, but as the invaders swept down upon his two baby sisters, he arose, took up the sword he had so despised, and single-handedly killed every invader. When his grim task was complete, Hai Jii dropped to his knees and begged Grenth to see to it that his family's murderers found no peace in the afterlife. Grenth heard Hai Jii's prayers, dooming the souls of the murderers to an eternity of fiery torture.''

  *Since this is a [[touch]] skill, it is effected by [[Expertise]] and is a very common skill for [[Ranger]] primaries to have on their skill bar. Other Professions that often have this skill on their skill bars include [[Warrior]]s, [[Dervish]]es, and [[Assassin]]s.

  No one but [[Shiro Tagachi]] knows what made this sacred imperial bodyguard\xE2\x80\x94the [[Emperor Angsiyan|emperor]]\xE2\x80\x99s most trusted servant\xE2\x80\x94turn on his master on the [[Day of the Jade Wind]]. Did Shiro plan to sever the unbroken imperial bloodline and crown himself emperor? Was it revenge he sought, for some perceived wrong the emperor had done to Shiro or the Tagachi family? Could Shiro have been seeking some form of power that historians can no longer comprehend?\n\n\
  Whatever his motive, Shiro\xE2\x80\x99s act has been literally carved in stone. On the last day of the [[Harvest Festival]], the emperor\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
  favored bodyguard arrived at the [[Harvest Temple]] and was waiting when the emperor reached the pinnacle of the temple\xE2\x80\x99s tower. Shiro cut down the emperor of [[Cantha]] where he knelt on the holy floor, staining it forever with the monarch\xE2\x80\x99s blood. Shiro himself was slain only moments later, but his revenge on those who killed him was the most significant event in Canthan history since Kaineng founded the empire. In Shiro\xE2\x80\x99s final moments, he drew on all of his ill-gotten power to drain the emperor\xE2\x80\x99s very soul away. Seething with [[magic]] but mortally wounded, the treacherous bodyguard screamed, and his voice washed over an area hundreds of miles across. Shiro\xE2\x80\x99s death wail became the [[Jade Wind]], a cataclysmic wave of energy that turned trees, animals, people, and open water into stone and crystal.\n\n\
  In the wake of Shiro\xE2\x80\x99s fall, the empire carried on. But Shiro\xE2\x80\x99s legacy on the continent is undeniable and permanent. Today, any signs point to Shiro\xE2\x80\x99s return after two centuries in the border realms of the afterlife. A spectral force driven by rage, a thirst for power, and a special kind of madness, he corrupts everything in his wake. The Canthan people know nothing of this, and suspect\n\
  that the hideous results of \xE2\x80\x9C[[Afflicted|the Affliction]]\xE2\x80\x9D are some kind of monstrous plague. But even those who know that Shiro stalks the shadows. have no idea of the power seething within him\xE2\x80\x94 or what he might do with it.\n\n\

  ==In-game description==\n\
  Although [[Cavalon]] is the [[Luxon]]'s home settlement, most prefer to stay on the move, returning only once every decade, when the [[Convocation]] brings together all of the three armadas. Traders from around the world come to buy the precious jade and rare seashells that the Luxon merchants sell here.\n\n\n\
  ==Getting there==\n\
  Complete the quest [[Journey to Cavalon]], acquired from [[Jamei]] in [[Maatu Keep]], to gain access via [[Zos Shivros Channel (outpost)|Zos Shivros Channel]].\n\n\
  There is an alternate roundabout way to enter Cavalon. From Zos Shivros Channel, exit into the [[Boreas Seabed (explorable area)|Boreas Seabed]] and head west into [[Mount Qinkai]]. Then, turn south to go through [[Breaker Hollow]] (or start from here if already unlocked), to the [[Archipelagos]]. From there, head east along the northern edge to enter Cavalon. Note that you still have to complete the above quest if you want to continue the [[campaign]] storyline.\n\n\

  As long as this spell remains in effect, magical shackles bind you as a slave to the [[Stone Summit]].
  
  ==Notes==
  *This is a [[spell]] used by [[Galen Trask]] after players accept the [[Summit Slaves]] quest. It has the advantage of making all the Stone Summit in [[Sorrow's Furnace]] friendly to the party. The disadvantage is that the party cannot attack the Summit. It will stay in effect as long as you don't leave Sorrow's Furnace (even death won't remove it).
  *This spell is not technically a [[hex]] or [[enchantment]], so skills such as [[Contemplation of Purity|Contemplation of Purity]] will not remove it.
  *This spell has no energy cost, activation time or recharge time.

  ''Tahmu was an empress well known for her generosity and kind spirit. The people of her lands were all her children, and she made sure none went without food and shelter. When the Naga attacked, her private guards urged her to flee the city that she might save her own life. But Tahmu would not abandon her children. She called to her people to take up arms and defend themselves against the Naga, and she herself went into the streets to do battle. Unfortunately, the Naga overpowered Tahmu and her people, keeping her alive to witness the torture and murder of every single person in the city. Enraged beyond reason, she managed to break from her bonds and call down fire from the heavens, which streaked through the streets in the form of a dragon, incinerating the Naga attackers.''

  He\xE2\x80\x99s older now, and though he\xE2\x80\x99s a well-liked king, his insistence that the army can hold back the beasts from the north has started the people whispering to each other in the streets. Not everyone agrees with the king on this matter. Making matters worse, [[Prince Rurik]], the king\xE2\x80\x99s eldest son and heir to the throne, is among those who criticize Adelbern\xE2\x80\x99s policies. And though he is close to his son, the king and the prince often do not see eye to eye.\n\n\

  [[Little Thom]] is first seen as a [[skill trainer]] for [[warrior]]s in [[The Barradin Estate]] in [[pre-Searing Ascalon]]. After the Searing, [[Farrah Cappo]] in [[Piken Square]] requested help in locating Little Thom with the quest [[The Red-Cloaked Deserter]]. He was said to have deserted Ascalon forces being rampaged by [[Charr]].\n\n\

  ==Little Thom, Brawler Henchman==\n\

  ==Evaluation==\n\
  Little Thom is described as a \"Brawler\" [[henchman]]. He carries an axe and charges into battles as soon as they are initiated. He is most useful to supplement a party lacking in high-damage [[Warrior]]s. Be aware that if not already fighting, Little Thom immediately engages any enemy that attacks a party member, be it by ranged attacks, spells or melee. This means of course he will very often rush right into the middle of an enemy group, drawing the attention of more enemies. He is also very reluctant to back off an enemy and retreat; you will have to run away quite far before he stops fighting and begins trying to catch up. \n\n\
  Little Thom is a fair alternative to [[Stefan]] with higher damage and a little less defensive strength. If you are not a warrior, it may be more effective to take both of them.  By taking both they manage to corner enemies and hold their attention better, and of course if one dies you still have another tank to fall back on.\n\n\
  '''Pros'''\n\
  *Can take a beating.\n\
  *Deals a fair amount of damage.\n\
  *Can be quite useful against enemies who use a lot of stances because of [[Wild Blow]].\n\
  '''Cons'''\n\
  *[[Stefan]] is slightly better defensively.\n\
  *Has same pathing issues as Stefan.\n\
  *Has a little deserter in him. Little Thom (unlike Stefan or [[Devona]]) has a tendency to back away if severely damaged to try and heal himself or get healing. He also tends to leave the party each time you enter a [[town]] or [[outpost]].\n\
  *Although he gets [[\"Charge!\"]] later in the [[campaign]], he does not use it often.\n\n\
  ==Dialogue==\n\
  :''\"Don't tell anyone you've seen me. I've got a few \"unpaid debts\" if you know what I mean. I'm a survivor that's for sure. Word of advice, when I get started you had best stay out of my way, for when I am in the midst of combat I often cleave so mightily that I'll slice through friend only to encounter foe! Or is it the other way around? I forget.\"''\n\n\

Fort Aspenwood: |-
  {{mission-stub}}
  {{pvp-stub}}
  {{Faction mission outpost link}}
  {{Mission infobox
  | name = Fort Aspenwood
  | campaign = Factions
  | region = Echovald Forest
  | type = Competitive
  }}
  
  PvP area where you can earn faction points and Balthazar points.
  
  ==General Mechanics==
  
  Fort Aspenwood is a Factions campaign competitive mission which takes place at Fort Aspenwood, a [[Kurzick]] fort held by [[Master Architect Gunther]], in which he is creating a weapon called God's Vengeance to use against the Luxon attackers.
  
  For this mission you are placed in random groups of 8 (similar to random arena but with 4 more people) the side you are on is dependant on the outpost you joined from. The Kurzick Fort Aspenwood has you on the Kurzick's side defending Fort Aspenwood on the blue team. The [[Luxon]] side of Fort Aspenwood has you on the red team to assault Fort Aspenwood.
  
  The Kurzick side will win once God's Vengeance is fully charged whereas the Luxon side wins as soon as Master Architect Gunther is killed. [[Raw Amber Chunks]] increase the Vengeance of the Gods' progression bar by 2%, [[Refined Amber Chunks]] increase it by 4%, the bar also progresses on its own at a rate of roughly 1% per 8 seconds.
  
  ==Mission information==
  
  ===Objectives===
  
  ====Luxon====
  Kill the Kurzick's Master Architect.
  * Order the Luxon gate commanders to dispatch troops to defeat the Kuzicks and their gate guards.
  * Help thwart the completion of the Kurzicks' weapon, God's Vengeance, by preventing them from gathering amber.
  * Take out Master Architect Gunther before God's Vengeance is complete.
  * Keep the amber mines and protect them to stop the Kurzicks from speeding up the completion of God's Vengeance and repairing their gates.
  * Protect the Siege Turtle squads so they can help you break through the gates and provide you with support.
  * Protect the Orange and Purple Command posts so the Siege Turtle squads can respawn.
  
  ====Kurzick====
  Defend Fort Aspenwood until The God's Vengance is complete.
  * Make sure that Master Architiect Gunther survives.
  * Deliver Amber to each of the gatekeepers to repair destroyed gates or to Gunther to speed up God's Vengeance.
  * Capture the amber mines to get access to amber.
  * Protect the amber mines to hinder the resurrection of Luxon players.
  * Capture the Green amber mine for refined amber (which has double the effect of regular amber on God's Vengeance).
  
  ===Rewards===
  * Kurzick players will receive a faction point reward of two times the final completion percentage of the Vengeance of the Gods.
  * Luxon players will receive 40 faction points for each unique gate destroyed during the mission.
  * Players on the winning team will be awarded a further bonus of 800 faction points.
  
  == Strategies ==
  
  ===General===
  =====Luxon=====
  *Do not be overly concerned by the loss of a command point - it is more important for the current siege turtle from that point to survive and do as much damage to the Kurzicks as possible. Commanders can be respawned simply by killing the Kurzick NPCs occupying that command point.
  *Remember that once a Gatekeeper is killed, gates of his color cannot be repaired again. A dead Gatekeeper is also incapable of healing Gunther, so in the best case scenario the death of both Gatekeepers would ensure maximum success.
  
  =====Kurzick=====
  *If a gate needs repairing, you should always give amber to its gatekeeper. The extra time this buys you is more beneficial than the few percentage points of progress Gunther rewards you with.
  *The green gate can be repaired by giving amber to either of the Gatekeepers. If the green gate is undamaged, the Gatekeeper will use the amber to repair one of his own color gates.
  *The gates are not very wide making them perfect places to put ranger traps down effective one's are [[Barbed Trap]], [[Spike Trap]] and [[Snare]] they along with [[Tripwire]] can help slow the Luxons getting through the fort.
  
  
  ===Skills===
  *In Fort Aspenwood, resurrection is near-instant (6 seconds). Bringing a resurrection skill is therefore a waste of a slot.
  *The large number of corpses (see above point) makes [[minion master|minion masters]] particularly effective.
  *Both the Luxons (getting from their spawn to the fort) and the Kurzicks (amber running) require to run significant distances, and will benefit from speed-increasing skills such as [[Dodge]] or [[Flame Djinn's Haste]].
  
  =====Luxon=====
  *Bring an enchantment removal skill. The Kurzick Elementalist NPCs use enchantments such as [[Sliver Armor]], and if a [[bonder]] is present on the Kurzick side, it can be nearly impossible to kill crucial NPCs such as the Kurzick Juggernaut. Common enchantment removal skills include [[Well of the Profane]], [[Rend Enchantments]] and [[Gaze of Contempt]].
  *Area of effect spells can be useful for taking out the gate-npc's as they usually won't move out of the area.
  *Bringing a monk with healing skills can keep a turtle alive for a long time. Protection monks are less effective as the turtle already has excellent defense due to [[Turtle Shell]] - the main threats to it are various forms of degen and life stealing inflicted by casters. Standing next to the turtle itself will protect you from melee attackers, who will be teleported away by the turtle's [[Carrier's Defense]] skill
  *Putting traps on the teleporter pad's can help slow down the Kurzick's amber runners.
  
  =====Kurzick=====
  *A bonder will almost guarantee success if the Luxon team does not have enchantment removal
  *Siege Turtles have a skill which increases their armor dramatically. It is therefore necessary to use [[health degeneration|degen]] skills such as [[Burning Arrow]], or armor-ignoring skills (such as life stealing) to kill them
  *The Siege Turtle Attack is a skill (not a spell or signet) - consider this when deciding which interrupts to bring. Even if you do not have the correct attributes for the skill's additional effect (e.g. Expertise for [[Distracting Shot]]) it may be worthwhile bringing the interrupt anyway
  *It is possible to take out the purple and orange amber mines from the ledges with the stairs between the outer and inner gates if you use a Longbow as its long range ensures the NPC's won't fire back on you. From the same points you can also attack the turtle when it gets closer to the outer gates.

  }}\n\
  [[Devona]] is quite serious and very direct in her dealings with other people. She aspires to be a great [[Warrior]], just like [[Mordakai|her father]]. Sometimes this aspiration turns into a tremendous internal pressure to succeed. Devona's father was one of the leaders of a prestigious and well-respected guild\xE2\x80\x94[[Ascalon's Chosen]]. He lost his life defending the city walls against a raid by a guild during the last [[The Guild Wars|Guild War]]. Devona was only a little girl at the time, but since that day, she has dedicated her life to mastering the martial arts of [[sword]] and [[hammer]].\n\n\
  Devona is the level-headed leader of the party. She always assesses any situation before rushing in. This sometimes puts her at odds with the brash [[Cynn]]. Despite this seeming level of restrain and control, Devona does have a temper, and it can get the best of her. She would sacrifice her own life to save the life of a friend, and she frequently puts herself in harm's way to protect those who travel with her. Devona has a very deep sense of loyalty and duty. To her, there would be no greater honor than to follow in the footsteps of her father and give her life defending that which is most dear to her.\n\n\

I hope he is watching me from [[the Mists]] and is proud of what I have become.

  ==Notes==\n\
  *Devona's personality seemed to change as she progressed through the campaigns - she seemingly had less of a noble and honourable edge during ''[[Guild Wars Factions|Factions]]'' and developed even more of an attitude in ''[[Guild Wars Nightfall|Nightfall]]''. In this sense she is the most developed character, personality-wise, in the ''Guild Wars'' universe.\n\
  *Devona also appears in many ''Guild Wars'' [[:Category:Stories|stories]].\n\n\
  ==Trivia==\n\
  *Devona is one of the only five (the other four being [[Cynn]], [[Aidan]], [[Eve]] and [[Mhenlo]]) characters to appear in all 3 campaigns.\n\
  *Before [[the Searing]], Devona was a captain in the Ascalon Army.\n\
  *She is the leader of the [[Heroes of Ascalon]].\n\n\

  *This [[monster skill]] is used by [[Margonite]]s, excluding those in the [[Domain of Anguish]].
  *This skill seems to be bugged. Although all enemies take the 70 damage, one enemy will take much more than this.  The targeted Margonite seems to gain the amount of health the severely damaged enemy takes.  
  *Because of its long casting time and the short duration of [[Abaddon's Chosen]], the Margonites will very rarely use this skill to good effect.  Even when they are able to use it, it is so easily interrupted that they rarely manage to cast it. If, however, the Margonite manages to activate this skill after casting [[Abaddon's Chosen]], the maximum duration of it is 4 seconds.

  ===Reward===
  {{Mission reward
  | objective = Time taken (minutes)
  | standard = > 25
  | expert = < 25
  | master = < 20 }}
  
  ==Walkthrough==
  The first steps should lead the player directly towards the first shrine of [[Zunraa]]. Zunraa is incredibly helpful in dealing with the [[miasma]] effect, therefore try to have it with you whenever possible. However Zunraa can be revived at all shrines, so there is no need to backtrack to the last shrine if the next one is just up ahead in case Zunraa dies. The biggest danger in this mission is the high constant damage caused from fighting in/near the miasma in combination with the [[Afflicted Soul Explosion]]. Your healers can easily get overwhelmed. Try to lure groups away from the miasma to fight them or rush through the miasma and fight on the other side if luring does not work. If affected by miasma, stay appart from the rest of the group to not infect them as well.
  
  After the second shrine of Zunraa, the mission path splits. It is possible to either go north or south. Generally, going north will be faster. Close to the end, the players face the two bosses [[Afflicted Yijo]] and [[Afflicted Farmer Xeng Jo]]. Don't let Yijo's [[Spirit Rift]] hit you while being balled up on the bridge. The last boss, [[The Afflicted Kana]], should pose less problems, since his group can be lured out of the miasma.
  
  ===Master's Reward===
  Like most factions boni, there is no inherent difference between doing the normal mission and masters. Groups going for master's should take the northern path since it is faster.
  
  ===Skill recommendations===
  *At least some form of interruption, since Yijo's [[Spirit Rift]] can be fatal for lower-level parties if not interrupted.

  Headmaster Vhang: ''Zen Daijun is overrun with the Afflicted. It is good that I am here to protect all of you.''
  
  Master Togo: ''In times of trouble, the people of this valley gather in the main temple to the west. We should seek Yijo there.''
  
  Master Togo: ''All right, follow me and stay close. We are in great danger.''
  
  ===Miasma===
  Headmaster Vhang: ''If you become diseased, (player name), make certain you keep your distance or you will infect us all.''
  
  ===Bell===
  Master Togo: ''Ring the bell at any of the shrines in this area to summon Zunraa, the guardian of this valley.''
  
  Master Togo: ''You can take the lead now. I will follow you and watch your progress.''
  
  ===Crossroad===
  Master Togo: ''Zen Daijun temple lies in the valley ahead. We can either travel south through the caves or north past the waterfall....''
  
  Headmaster Vhang: ''Either path will suit me. The sooner we set out, the sooner I shall wipe this plague from my homeland.''
  
  ===Encounter===
  Headmaster Vhang: ''Look! The affliction has claimed them all. Even Farmer Xeng Jo has been corrupted. Yijo should have known he could not handle this on his own.''
  
  Master Togo: ''Headmaster Vhang, that is enough! Yijo gave his life protecting those around him. There is no more noble act.''
  
  Master Togo: ''I know it is difficult, my friends, but we must put an end to their suffering. They would want us to do so. Let us help their spirits find rest.''
  
  ===Source===
  Master Togo: ''Look up ahead! That building is engulfed by miasma. Surely the source of the plague lies up there.''
  
  Headmaster Vhang: ''Let us destroy Afflicted Kana, and put an end to this infestation!''
  
  ===Ending Cinematic===
  Master Togo: ''I had hoped that my eyes would not bear witness to this symbol again.''
  
  (player name): ''Master, what is it?''
  
  Master Togo: ''This is the harbinger of the deceiver, the mark of the wicked.''
  
  Master Togo: ''The guild symbol of Shiro Tagachi.''
  
  (player name): ''The man whose death turned the forest to stone and the sea to jade?''
  
  Master Togo: ''The very same.''
  
  Master Togo: ''This does not bode well for Cantha.''
  
  Master Togo: ''We must head to the mainland and get to the root of this evil before it can...''
  
  Master Togo: ''Well, let us not think about that yet.''
  
  Master Togo: ''I have sent a missive to Mhenlo of Ascalon, one of my former students.''
  
  Master Togo: ''He will no doubt be making his way to Cantha shortly.''
  
  Master Togo: ''If this symbol means what I think it does, then we could all be in great danger.''
  
  Master Togo: ''I must find my brother in Kaineng City. He will want to know of this.''
  
  Master Togo: ''You will come after and meet me.''
  
  Master Togo: ''Talk to First Mate Xiang to book your passage to the mainland.''
  
  Master Togo: ''He will get you to the other side safely.''

  *Odurra is one of three henchmen who will not get an [[elite skill]] at level 20. This [[Talk:List of Nightfall henchmen#Elite skills for Odurra, Gehraz and Aidan in Nightfall|was confirmed]] to be intentional.
  *In the game Odurra is referred to as ''Illusion henchman'', although she has not a single [[Illusion Magic]]-skill on her bar.

  :''\"Have you ever encountered creatures with skills you would like to learn? With a '''Signet of Capture''', you can do just that.

You can recognize these '''powerful foes''' by the '''auras''' surrounding them. After destroying such a foe, activate your '''Signet of Capture''' and select one of that foe's skills. You can only capture skills that your profession can use, but even so, this Signet is an extremely valuable resource.

  [[Roaring Ether]]s are found in [[Vabbi]]. They resemble large lions and are dangerous mesmers. Their skills make them deadly to a bunched up party. Coupled with the fact that they are almost always grouped with one or two [[djinn]], and can often resurrect each other, it makes them very lethal.
  
  Unlike other elementals, these are [[fleshy]] creatures and will leave [[exploitable corpse]]s. They also possess neither a vulnerability nor a resistance to a specific elemental [[damage]] type.

  *This skill can help mitigate party skillbar clutter in a mostly pet party by allowing one to bring the group ressurection skill thus saving others a skill slot.
  *The range for this skill is much shorter than the resurrection range of [[Comfort Animal]] and one must practically stand on the dead pet for it or others to revive making it unwieldy in battle.
  *The slow cast time also makes it easy to interrupt with possibly devastating results if multiple party members are relying on this skill to revive their fallen pets.

  * [[Ascended]] character\n\
  * Not having [[Ranger]] as original [[Profession#Secondary profession|secondary profession]]\n\n\

  * Go to the [[Salt Flats]] and slay the [[Yxthoshth]].\n\

  * 1,000 [[Experience]]\n\
  * Unlocks [[Ranger]] for [[Profession#Secondary profession|secondary profession]]\n\n\
  ==Walkthrough==\n\
  For this quest its best to bring some kind of interrupt, because of the [[Hydra]] that you will encounter on your path.\n\
  Even though this quest is almost right outside the town you get it, its still best that you don\xC2\xB4t rush towards the boss. The [[Storm Kin]] are patroling everywhere and you don\xC2\xB4t want them all over you when you reach the boss. So taking your time killing everything in your path is a good idea. Once Yxthoshth comes in to visual range, the [[Storm Kin]] near him will head right for you. Instead of running for the boss, take your time killing those and any returning patrols. Once all that is done, you can kill the boss in peace without getting any suprices. For [[Mesmer]] primaries or secondaries, its a good idea to bring a [[Signet of Capture]]. The boss has the [[Crippling Anguish]] elite skill, you can cap here early.\n\n\
  ==Dialogue==\n\
  <!-- Transcription of dialogue. -->\n\n\
  ===Initial dialogue===\n\
  :''\"As a follower of Melandru, I have a deep love and respect for nature. Indeed, all Rangers, even those who do not view our craft in a spiritual light, rely on the rule of nature to exercise their talents. That is why we have to abhor all that is unnatural and corrupt.''\n\n\
  :''Ages ago, a power-mad mage named Sybitha unleashed the monstrous storm riders upon this land. One of her first and most powerful roams the Salt Flats to this very day, an ancient and corrupt creature the Centaurs call [[Yxthoshth]]. Do not be enticed by the path Sybitha followed. Destroy this foul beast and let us call you an ally and friend of nature.\"''\n\n\
  :Accept:\n\
  ::''\"I will hunt down this creature.\"''\n\n\
  :Decline:\n\
  ::''\"I'm not interested.\"''\n\n\
  :When asked about quest:\n\
  ::''\"These ancient lands have witnessed the misdeeds of many who came here seeking power. All my life, I strove to undo the wickedness they unleashed, but one monster escaped me. Help me, and will I share with you Melandru's secrets. (sic) Go to the Salt Flats and destroy Yxthoshth!\"''\n\n\
  ===Reward dialogue===\n\
  :''\"The destruction of Yxthosnth has been long in coming.  I tell you, (character name), I feel as though a great burden has been lifted from my shoulders, and even through the veil of death, I feel that I may once again appreciate the natural beauty of the world around me.\n\n\
  :''You have my gratitude, and I will gladly repay you if I can.  Should you ever wish to learn what it is to be a Ranger, all you need to do is ask.  I have no greater gift to give than that.\"''\n\n\

  A former child prodigy, [[Cynn]] always had people catering to her every whim. Her family was among the nobility in the city of [[Surmia]]\xE2\x80\x94until the [[Charr]] invasion and [[the Searing]]. When [[Ascalon]] was destroyed, Cynn got caught outside the Wall (Surmia was one of the first places to fall during the initial assault). A magical projectile fell directly upon her palatial home, killing her parents and trapping her under a broken table for several days. A Charr warband discovered her while looting the city. They dug her out, thinking to make a meal of her, but Cynn had other ideas. She single-handedly wiped out the entire warband, turning them and the remains of her home into little more than a smoldering pile of ash.\n\n\
  Cynn is a bit of a princess but with a decidedly dark streak. She's often cynical and flippant when dealing with authorities or situations that seem hopeless. She's highly intelligent, and magic comes easy to her. Because of her experiences during the Searing, Cynn has developed a rather cavalier attitude toward her own death. Consequently, she tends to bite off more than she can chew, and often gets herself and her friends into trouble. She is one of the [[Heroes of Ascalon]].\n\n\
  Cynn is an [[Elementalist]] who specializes in [[Fire Magic]].\n\n\

  From here, it is a case of following the quest pointer to each of the 3 groups, and defeating any hostile groups encountered along the way.  Note that the groups can be saved in any order, not necessarily the order listed in the objectives.\n\n\
  At each survivor group, there will be 3-4 [[Margonite]] groups patrolling nearby, so careful [[pull]]ing of each group is required.\n\n\
  On arrival at the Kodash Bazaar, walk up to the entrance, but do not walk in (or leave the area) until the quest updates, otherwise the quest will not complete properly.\n\n\
  ==Dialogue==\n\
  ===Initial dialogue===\n\
  '''Lieutenant Murunda'''\n\
  :''\"It's just awful what became of the temple when Nightfall arrived. Lucky ones fled and scattered into the surround area. '''Prince Ahmtur''' is searching for survivors in the Mirror of Lyss with a small contingent of soldiers. I'm worried about him, but I know he'd be furious if I chased him down. I don't know what I...what WE would do without him. Would you '''find''' him?\"''\n\
  :'''Accept:''' ''\"Of course. I'll see to his safety right away.\"''\n\
  :'''Decline:''' ''\"The prince doesn't need a babysitter.\"''\n\
  :'''When asked about quest:''' ''\"Have you found '''Prince Ahmtur''' yet? He's somewhere in '''the Mirror of Lyss''' seaching for survivors of the Nightfall.\"''\n\n\
  ===Intermediate dialogue===\n\
  '''Prince Ahmtur the Mighty'''\n\
  :''\"For hours I've been searching for temple sruvivors with no luck. I'm beginning to fear the worst, but I don't want to give up until I've checked everywhere. I'd never forgive myself if someone was left behind, but I must attend to my own people, as well. Please, take these men with you and finish what I am unable to.\"''\n\n\
  ===Intermediate dialogue (priest)===\n\
  :'''Priest Tuwahan:''' ''\"Horrible! People screaming...death everywhere. I was separated from a group. They might still be alive. I saw a family with a little girl and a group of students out in the field. They could still be out there...trapped.\"''\n\n\
  ===Intermediate dialogue (family)===\n\
  :'''Belanu:''' ''\"Thank Lyssa! We thought we were done for. We saw a group of students back that way. We could not stop to help them in our rush to escape.\"''\n\
  :'''Charmah:''' ''\"Papa, are they going to hurt us?\"''\n\
  :'''Vabbi Guard:''' ''\"No, child, We are here to help, but we must hurry. Let's go!\"''\n\n\
  ===Intermediate dialogue (students)===\n\
  :'''Zardok:''' ''\"Please, help us escape this madness!\"''\n\
  :'''Nokawa:''' ''\"We saw a family of three fleeing the temple, but there could still be priests left inside. Can we please go now? It's dangerous here.\"''\n\n\
  ===Intermediate dialogue (at Kodash Bazaar)===\n\
  :'''Priest Tuwahan:''' ''\"Thank you all! I would not have made it back if it were not for your help. May Lussa guide you on your travels.\"''\n\
  :'''Belanu:''' ''\" ''\"You and your companions have my greatest thanks. We will not forget this act of kindness.\"''\n\n\
  ===Reward dialogue===\n\
  '''Lieutenant Murunda'''\n\
  :''\"It's good to know you have brought those survivors some peace this day, but they are forever transformed in the wake of the horrors they've witnessed. Please, accept this token of my gratitude.\"''\n\n\
  ==Notes==\n\
  * The survivor groups follow the party around, but do not join as allies, so they are not attacked by hostile groups (except for any accidental [[AoE]] effects targeted on the party members).\n\
  * The vabbi guards and captain seem to have a simple defensive skill set: [[\"Watch Yourself!\"]], [[\"Shields Up!\"]], [[Healing Signet]], and [[Endure Pain]]. No observed attack skills. Their shouts will ''NOT'' affect the party, only each other.\n\
  * Sometimes, the guards may need to be ''led'' towards any hostile groups that you are attacking. This can be a problem for solo (with henchmen) players who use ranged attacks and skills, since you may have to move into close [[aggro]] range to ensure the guards start to attack.\n\
  * Priest Tuwahan from this quest is quite close to Hanbahd from [[The Madness of Prophecy]] quest, and since you will have 5 guard npcs to assist, that quest can also be completed very easily while doing this one.\n\n\

  }}
  [[Kormir]] has been captured! She's arranged to be executed, but with the assistance of [[Margrid the Sly]], you've managed to secure a set of Kournan armor and plan on infiltrating Gandara to rescue her. As her price, Margrid asks that you also help her aquire the Diadem of Lady Glaive from the base's vault. After which you will proceed to the prison, break out Kormir, and rush to the docks to escape.
  
  This mission represents a branch in the storyline which is determined by your choice of Margrid the Sly or [[Master of Whispers]]. If you have Master of Whispers, you may return to this mission after completing [[Abaddon's Gate]], or enter the mission with someone who has Margrid the Sly.
  
  ==Mission information==
  
  ===Requirements===
  Margrid the Sly must be in your party to enter this mission.
  
  ===Objectives===
  * Escort Margrid to the Gandaran treasure vault to retrieve the Diadem of Lady Glaive. 
  * Free Kormir from the Kournan prisoners. 
  * '''Bonus''' Complete optional objectives 
  * '''Added''' Optional: Escort the Sunspear prisoners to the prison. 
  * '''Added''' Optional: Obtain the prison code for entry into the prison. 
  * '''Added''' Optional: The demon is out of control! You can either help the guards or stand aside and let them fight on their own. 
  * '''Added''' Optional: Take over gate duty for some guards 
  
  ===Rewards===
  The reward depends on the number of optional objectives completed around the fortress before you free Kormir.
  {{Mission reward
  | objective = Optional objectives accomplished
  | standard = 0-2
  | expert = 3
  | master = 4}}
  
  ==Walkthrough==
  Until you break out Kormir, you will be disguised as a Kournan and will not be attacked by them. You may use this time to accomplish bonus tasks. When ready, proceed to the vault labeled on the minimap(5). Margrid will convince the guards to hand over the gem she seeks. 
  
  Proceed to the prison gate(6). The guard will ask for the password to enter. If you acquired the password from the guard at the entrance of the fort, you can pass through unobstructed. However, should you not have the password or choose the option to give the wrong password, the guard will attack. Since the later half of the mission is timed, players may choose to purposely give the incorrect password to dispatch these foes before the timer begins. Either way, the gate to the prison will open for you. Upon reaching the prison, dispatch the jailor and all the guards and a cutscene will ensue(7).
  
  You now have fifteen minutes to reach the docks with Kormir and Shahai. A number of guards will confront you at the bridge and multiple groups at the stairs just past the prison gates. Watch out for overlapping patrol paths to avoid overaggro here. After dispatching this group, you may either travel north through the fort or south through along the docks. Either way, the paths rejoin close to the docked ship with a number of Kournan standing in the way. [[Captain Nebo]] should be dispatched as soon as possible as the elementalist boss is capable of dealing massive damage to an area with fire spells. After dispatching this group, proceed to the end of the dock to complete the mission. Alternatively, a player may choose not to fight this last group but rather rush past groups to lead Kormir and Shahai to the end of the dock(9).
  
  ===Bonus===
  Before the cutscene at the prison, players may talk to a number of Kournan guards to find and accomplish 4 optional objectives for the bonus. However, after the cutscene, the entire fortress becomes hostile and any remaining optional goals will be unavailable, so complete the bonus objectives before you cross the bridge to the prison.
  #Upon entering the fortress, talk to Guard Captain Kahturin for the prison's password. You don't need to write it down and you don't need to give the password to the prison guard to get credit for the objective.
  #Just inside the fortress and to the south, you'll find captive Sunspear Prisoners. Talk to the guard and agree to "escort" them to the prison. They will also help you in combat once you free Kormir.
  #Towards the center of the fort you'll find two guards trying to suppress a renegade demon. Defeat the demon to accomplish the objective.
  #Around the southeast of the fortress you'll find Guard Linko. Agree to take over his guard duty for this objective.
  
  ===Skill recommendations===
  *All the foes you will be facing will be typical Kournan troops. [[Wild Blow]] or skills that cannot be blocked are helpful in quickly dispatching rangers.
  *The final Elementalist boss is quite dangerous to the NPCs you must keep alive. [[Ward Against Harm]] and/or [[Ward Against Elements]] may help reduce the damage if they stay in the wards. Interrupts may also help against the boss. Give Margrid [[Distracting Shot]] and/or [[Savage Shot]] and lock her on the boss to help suppress damage.

  '''Dunes of Despair''' is one of the missions required to achieve [[ascension]] in Prophecies.  
  
  ==Mission information==
  
  ===Objectives===
  Help the [[Ghostly Hero]] reclaim his throne.
  *Escort the Ghostly Hero to the Temple of Ascension. 
  *Defeat the Enemy Ghostly Hero. 
  *Hold out while the Ghostly Hero performs his ritual. 
  *'''Bonus''' Gain more glory by defeating the three forgotten generals and their minions within their forts
  
  ==Walkthrough==
  After talking with the Ghostly Hero, he will drop the gate, allowing the party to proceed. Note that he will follow the first player to talk with him. If that player talks to him again, he will stay put until someone talks with him again. Following the path, you'll run into small groups of [[Losaru Bladehand]]s. After the bladehands, you'll see a group of [[Losaru Bowmaster]]s. When attacking the bowmasters, you'll be under constant attack from a distant [[Siege Wurm]]. From here, you can either continue down the path towards a suspension bridge across the gorge, or you can take a short cut by leading the Ghostly Hero to the edge across from the drawbridge near the wurm. In any case, proceed across to the other side of the gorge.
  
  Once on the other side, you may choose to go continue the mission by proceeding south and killing the boss there, or you can proceed to the west to get the [[Slow Totem]] '''(Point E)'''. When on the ground, the totem will create an effect much like [[Ward Against Foes]], [[snare|snaring]] any foe that attempts to pass through. While slightly useful, it is not necessary. Eventually, make your way south towards the fortress looking building and defeat the boss and his cohorts to trigger a cutscene.
  
  After the cutscene, approach the drawbridge. You may choose to have the Ghostly Hero to hold back, allowing the party to kill off the [[Enchanted Bow]]s guarding the gate. The Ghostly Hero will lower the drawbridge when he approaches it. Afterwards, have the party hold back in the gateway. If you have the Slow Totem, drop it slightly ahead of where the party is waiting. Four groups of [[Enchanted Sword]]s and [[Enchanted Hammer]]s will eventually attack. The only foe left in sight should now be the enemy Ghostly Hero at the alter '''(Point D)'''. Defeat him and have your Ghostly Hero approach to capture it and begin the last stage of the mission. You must defend him for the next ten minutes.
  
  If you have the Slow Totem, drop it near the Ghostly Hero to help delay melee approaching him. But before any melee troops appear, [[Forgotten Arcanist]]s will come in pairs from the west, east, and south. Afterwards, a Seige Wurm will start pelting your party with attacks from the east. There is sufficient time to kill the seige wurm before the next group attacks, but it is just as easy to simply heal the damage and ignore the wurm.
  
  At the five or six minute mark, groups of forgotten will approach the altar, including a boss. Another pair of seige wurms will appear on the west. If you defeat the forgotten, there will be no more groups attacking the altar, and you can use the time to kill off the wurms. After the ten minutes has past, the mission ends.
  
  ===Bonus===
  The bonus for this mission is often regarded as one of the more difficult ones. During the final seige where you defend the Ghostly Hero, you must kill three bosses (and their groups) located south of the fortress without letting the hero die and before the ten minute timer hits zero. To make things even more fun, killing a general and its group spawns a small group of forgotten who approach the altar to attack the hero. You still get credit for the bonus if the Ghostly Hero dies as long as you kill all three generals first.
  
  '''Clear The Way'''
  
  After the Arcanists are clear, there is a time delay before the Forgotten attack the altar again. A party with a high damage output can often use this lapse to rush the southern fort and take out the generals before the Ghostly Hero dies. Variations of this often include a monk staying back to heal the Ghostly Hero, allowing the party more time to finish the bonus. A [[bonder]] monk is usually chosen for this task. The attacking party may also opt to kill the first general, pull back to defend against the remaining attacks, then try to kill the last two generals with the couple of minutes that remain. You can often kill the first general even before the timer begins by having the Ghostly Hero wait before capturing the altar and using distance attacks from the southern cliffs next to the drawbridge.
  
  '''Necrotic Traversal'''
  
  Take the Ghostly Hero with you to ('''Point A''') on the map, while avoiding '''(Point D)''' at this time. While the drawbridges are still up, you may be able to find a foe (either a [[Jade Scarab]] or the first general) close enough so the party can kill it with distance attacks. As long as the corpse is with in spell range, anyone with [[Necrotic Traversal]] or [[Consume Corpse]] can jump across the gorge''' (Point B)'''. The player that does this should also have [[Rebirth]]. One party member should stay back with the Hero, while the remaining party members should meet at '''(Point C)''' to kill themselves with [[sacrifice]] skills, [[vampiric]] weapons, or by letting themselves die from Jade Scarabs within spell range of the rebirther. Once across, the Generals '''(Point 1)''' can be killed without time constraints nor with worrying about the Ghostly Hero dying. Once the Generals are killed, the member that stayed behind can take the Hero to the alter '''(Point D)''' to start the timer, which will also let the rest of the team back in after the drawbridges drop.
  
  Alternatively, If all members go to kill the Generals, on the North-East side of the temple is an area in the sand dunes with a chest (East of where Goss Aleessh was) that usually spawns a few scarabs. Running along the edge between the outside of the temple and these sand dunes should make the scarabs spawn - kill them and the Necro can teleport back over and lead the hero to the altar. If the necro is a hero (e.g. Olias), get him to rebirth you back across so you can lead the hero yourself.
  
  This method allows a single person with an all hero/hench team to complete this mission and bonus, providing that the person is either a necro themselves or has access to a necro/monk hero (need to be able to control the character, so a henchman is no use) and a method of suicide for their own character.
  
  ===Skill recommendations===
  *If using the untimed method for the bonus, ensure someone has both [[Necrotic Traversal]] (or [[Consume Corpse]]) and [[Rebirth]].
  *If using a Bonder monk to stay with the Ghostly hero, use [[Life Barrier]], [[Life Bond]], [[Mending]] and [[Essence Bond]] on the Ghostly hero.  Have [[Heal Other]] and [[Orison of Healing]] or [[Dwayna's Kiss]] equiped.  The bonder monk can stand in the north door way near the bridge to stay out of the way while the bonds protect the Ghostly Hero and run in only when he/she needs to use [[Heal Other]] or [[Dwayna's Kiss]].

  ** Use a build with little energy dependence.  For instance: on a [[Warrior]] primary, or on a signet-heavy build.
  ** Follow up with [[Ether Signet]].

  :'''Profession:''' [[Paragon]]\n\n\
  From the manual:\n\
  :''Three generals report directly to Warmarshal [[Varesh Ossa]]. General Morgahn has known her the longest, having served under her father for decades. When Varesh was born, Morgahn spent years assisting with her training and the shaping of her character. As a loyal patriot, he considers duty and honor to be the highest virtues a soldier can have. Although Varesh is curious about lofty philosophical concepts like Ascension, Morgahn keeps to a simple faith. He's a devout follower of the goddess [[Lyssa]], holding great respect for artists and crafters. Like any good soldier, he chants his prayers to [[Balthazar]] when charging into battle, but in the dark of night, it's his faith in Lyssa that sustains him.''\n\n\

  A message need to be delivered, but it involves a long and potentially dangerous trek.  Rather than doing it herself, Envoy Ero seeks a hearty group of adventurers to do it for her.\n\n\
  This is not to be confused with the [[Mysterious Message (Nightfall quest)|Nightfall primary quest]] of the same name.\n\n\
  ==Quest information==\n\n\
  ===Objectives===\n\
  * Drop the mysterious message into the hollow log.\n\
  * Let [[Alari Doubleblade]] know that the message has been delivered.\n\n\

  * {{e}}{{skill icon|Stone Daggers}}\n\n\
  ==Walkthrough==\n\
  Make the trek into [[Mamnoon Lagoon]] from either [[Druid's Overlook]] or [[The Wilds (outpost)|The Wilds]].  Once there, you will find groups of [[Jungle Skale]] and patrols of 5 [[Wind Rider]]s circling the lagoon that can be quite challenging for mid-level characters.  It is possible to avoid the rider patrols, though.\n\n\
  Put the message in the log and circle the lake to get to the next zone, [[Silverwood]].  From there head west and talk to Alari Doubleblade.  Alternatively, if you have been to either [[Quarrel Falls]] or [[Bloodstone Fen (outpost)|Bloodstone Fen]], you can map out and start from there.\n\n\
  ==Dialogue==\n\n\
  ===Initial dialogue===\n\
  '''Envoy Ero'''\n\
  :''\"Are you with the Shining Blade?  I come in peace bearing a message for them.  I am supposed to have dropped the message in a '''hollow log''' located in someplace called '''Mamnoon Lagoon''', but quite frankly, this forest makes me nervous.  If you would be so good as to deliver the message for me, I'm certain your friends in the Shining Blade would be most appreciative.  After you drop off the message, seek out Alari Doubleblade in Silverwood and tell him that the message has been delivered.\"''\n\
  :'''Accept:''' ''\"I'll deliver the message.\"''\n\
  :'''Decline:''' ''\"I am no mere messenger.\"''\n\
  :'''When asked about quest:''' ''\"Place the message in the '''hollow log'''.  It is to the west in '''Mamnoon Lagoon'''.  Remember to inform Alari Doubleblade in Silverwood that is has benn delivered.\"''\n\n\
  ===Reward dialogue===\n\
  '''Alari Doubleblade'''\n\
  :''\"Ero gave the message to you to deliver?  I'd kill that cowardly son of a skale if he wasn't so useful.  I know it might look bad that I'm speaking to the White Mantle, but I have been blackmailing Ero for information on their troop movements.  Tell nobody about this arrangement;  if it gets back to the wrong people, our information will literally be cut off at the source.\"''\n\n\
  ==Notes==\n\
  This quest may confuse first-time players because when you get to Druid's Overlook in the storyline you are aligned with the White Mantle chasing down the Shining Blade to save the [[Chosen]] they've kidnapped.  Events in [[The Wilds]] and [[Bloodstone Fen]] explain what happens.  \n\n\
  Alari further compounds the confusion by giving you [[The Price of Steel]], which sends you to [[Quarrel Falls]] and can cause you to skip those missions and break the storyline.\n\n\
  Although the NPC's in this quest refer to each other as males in the dialogue, they are both women."

Wizard's Isle: "{{Guild hall infobox\n\
  | image = [[Image:Wizards_Isle.jpg|200px|Wizard's Isle]]\n\
  | region = [[Ascalon (Pre-Searing)]]\n\
  | map = [[Image:Wizard's Isle map.jpg|200px|Wizard's Isle map]]\n\
  }}\n\
  It has happened to many new guilds\xE2\x80\x94they put some wins under their belt but then, suddenly, bump into strange maps and start taking losses. Not from a lack of skill, necessarily, but perhaps from a lack of knowledge about the unfamiliar terrain or assorted quirks of these maps. Talking to the [[Canthan Ambassador]] [[NPC]] in the [[Great Temple of Balthazar]] does help to get a basic orientation for each map, but many map features only become active during an actual [[Guild Battle]].\n\n\
  To see active aspects of your own guild hall, you can simply set up a [[scrimmage]] with at least one other person. This will allow you to see all NPC locations, flag spawn points, gate levers, and any item spawn points. To get comfortable with other guild halls will just take time playing on those maps. However, below we will give you some points to consider and tricks you can use as you move into unfamiliar terrain.\n\n\
  Wizard's Isle is very similar to [[Hunter's Isle]] and [[Warrior's Isle]].\n\n\
  ==[[Guild Thief]]==\n\
  Wizard's Isle features a [[Guild Thief]] that is used to open the gate of the opponents base. To use a Guild Thief, one of the human players on your team will have to ''talk'' to the Guild Thief, and it will follow this person around the map until this player ''talks'' with it again.\n\n\
  The Guild Thief has one primary use, which is to open the gates of the opponents base within the 20 minutes of normal GvG play. (At [[VoD]] all gates open, so the Guild Thief is no longer necessary.)\n\n\
  A secondary use for the Guild Thief on this particular map is to stall the opponents [[NPC]]s from their march to the flagstand when [[VoD]] starts at 20 minutes in the game. The player, who the Thief is following, will ''talk'' with it when it is standing close to the main gate into the opponents base. The opponents [[NPC]]s will start to attack the Guild Thief and while doing this, make a good target for the [[Trebuchet]].\n\n\
  ==Trebuchets==\n\
  Wizard's Isle, like [[Hunter's Isle]] and [[Warrior's Isle]] features two [[Trebuchet]]s, that can be used to lay siege to an area inside the base the Trebuchet overlooks.\n\n\
  ==Defensive Team==\n\
  Wizard's Isle is commonly chosen because it looks cool.  Many people like the \"presearing\" style grass and sky.  Its very popular among casual or pve guilds, and is often considered a \"generic\" map for GvG.  Unfortunately, this map has some serious defensive gaps for the home team.\n\n\
  Of the three sister maps (Wizard's Isle, [[Hunter's Isle]], and [[Warrior's Isle]]), Wizard's Isle is the least defensible for the home team.  Because the Trebuchet makes most of the inner area indefensible and because the inner walls protect the attacking team from your archers, the attacking team can easily break a turtling team.  It is very common for an attacker to kill the inner archers and such with hexes from a position of safety.  Unfortunately, the outer six archers are also more vulnerable than the archers on the other two sister maps.  Because an attacker can easily get to them (close stairs) and because they don't cover each other, they provide almost no support.  On the positive side, none of them will get hit by a siege before VOD.\n\n\
  However, the res shrine on this map is much closer to the alternative exit than the other two maps.  This means you can often sneak one or two people out of the base without being noticed to gank or repair the siege.  Furthermore, the inner gap in your walls can be used to quickly switch sides while the attacking team is forced to go all the way around.  You can also cover your res shrine from inside the safety of your inner area generally speaking.\n\n\
  ==Attacking Team==\n\
  Ironically, the attacking team has substantially better defense than the defensive team.  When you are the attacking defending your ship, your outer six archers are reasonably well placed.  The \"gate\" archers will cover each other, as will the inner archers.  This is very nice as the DPS helps and the twin pin down spike is nice to help you snare and kill a ganker.  Only one archer is subject to cata fire, which is better than your sister maps.\n\n\
  The inner area can be very secure to turtle in.  The footies don't often aggro past the bridge and your archers have a clean line of sight.  Finally, that there is even some cover inside the protected area.  Furthermore, because your flag spawns within your protected area, it can be easier to pick it up and push out unlike many maps where you have to push into the other team to pick up the flag. \n\n\
  However, covering people who res requires the turtled team to push onto the bridge, which can expose you.  Furthermore, there is enough space to the eastern corner of your base that the other team can stand there, let your NPCs walk by without aggroing at VOD, then resume the attack on your lord.  This is common when they have an NPC advantage or have a cata ready, and there is very little you can do about it.  But before VOD, your turtle is strong.\n\n\
  ==Disputed Ground==\n\n\
  The little wooden area is a runner's nightmare.  It is easy to bodyblock and force boosts.\n\n\
  Both bases have relatively small gates, so it is easy to reverse body block on ganks or to pin people inside their base for sieges.  \n\n\
  As with all trebuchet maps, both sides are subject to serious clumping issues as the NPCs move out of the base at vod.  Both sides are also vulnerable to NPC herding for sieging (have a physical or the thief stand at the gate at vod, which will aggro all the NPCs long enough for a siege).\n\n\
  Like your sister maps, there is a large open area on both the SE and NW corners of the map.  This gives a ganker the ability to push far back as he sneaks out, hopefully beyond the range where they can see you on the map or by pressing alt.  This makes it easy to ninja repair a siege or gank, although because of the limited movement in any direction you are susceptible to a collapse.\n\n\
  The defensive team's kit area is also fairly close to the flag.  This makes it a common place to drop spirits that are hard to kill (because they have to push all the way through your outer three archers and up the hill).  A ranger can also sit on that ledge and use his bow reasonably well, although you risk the other team falling back and forcing you to waste time by running around.\n\n\
  ==Overall==\n\n\
  This hall is not popular in high end GvG, and for good reason.  The defending team has poor position and the random nature of catapults plus the risk of NPCs getting sieged or blown up by aoe is a great liability.  On the other hand, if you are designed to play defensively and stall until VOD, the wooden gate area + cata may be an asset to you.  For general play, however, this hall is weak on defense, doesn't provide great splitting opportunities, and doesn't have anything that is tactically advantageous.\n\n\

  | preceded by = [[A Brother's Fury]]

  }}
  After a long hunt for the shining blade to rescue the chosen, the heroes are in for a surprise ending.
  
  ==Mission information==
  ===Objectives===
  Hunt down the [[Shining Blade]] kidnappers, and rescue the [[Chosen]] they have taken hostage.
  * Chase the fleeing Shining Blade.
  * Rescue the Chosen.
  * Discover how the Shining Blade navigates the jungle.
  * '''Bonus''' Defeat the two [[Centaur]] chieftains.
  
  ==Walkthrough==
  Follow the path north. Be careful when you see [[Entangling Roots]], approaching these will often trigger gates which can cut off the forward part of the party from the rest, while simultaneously triggering hidden spawns. Killing the roots opens these gates again.
  
  At the first junction take the middle (westward) road. Be careful about the centaur patrols, which tend to roam around, unaware parties can aggro several of them at the same time. It pays to take a look at the wiki map, since the map is somewhat labyrinth like, especially in the north-western section. After you have fought your way to Saidra, protect the chosen by eliminating the final spider spawn to finish the mission.
  ===Bonus===
  The bonus for this mission is relatively tricky; while the end goal of defeating two [[Centaur]] chieftains is simple enough, the bonus is hard to collect, and the chieftains not easy to get to.
  
  Take the southern instead of the middle road at the start of the mission. Do not attack the two [[Centaur|Centaurs]] (1) until after they have finished talking, or you'll be unable to get the bonus. Once they've finished talking, the bonus objective will show up, and they're safe to kill. Collect the [[Vine Seed]] they drop. Backtrack to get to the mission path (following the road north is a detour).
  
  Deviate from the mission path again at point (2); use the Vine Seed to form a bridge. Head down to point (3), and eliminate the two [[Centaur]] chieftains. Be careful, a large group of centaurs including two other bosses blocks your way. Part of the group can be pulled without aggroing the bosses.

  The wise king of the [[Deldrimor Dwarves]], [[King Jalis Ironhammer]] rules his people from the peaks of the [[Shiverpeak Mountains]]. He is a smart, strong, patient man who makes decisions based solely on how they will affect the well-being of all the dwarves in Deldrimor. He lives to serve his people, and they love and respect him for it.\n\n\
  There are those, however, who wish to see the good king taken out of power. Namely, the [[Stone Summit]], a group of xenophobic dwarves who have broken their ties with Deldrimor and are trying to take control of the dwarven nation. Over the past several years, the Summit have been growing their power, and a civil war is brewing.\n\n\
  King Jalis Ironhammer does not want to fight other dwarves, but he will do what he must to keep his people safe. Along with his loyal brother, [[Brechnar Ironhammer]], the king has rallied his forces, and they stand ready to defend their home. The question on the king\xE2\x80\x99s mind though is this: Can he win?\n\n\

  | region = Kourna

  | requiredhero = Melonni
  | duration = Medium
  | preceded by = [[Heart or Mind: Ronjok in Danger]]
  | followed by = [[Crossing the Desolation]]
  }}
  [[Melonni]] has been having nightmares that her home village of [[Ronjok]] is under threat from [[Abaddon]]'s forces.  You return with Melonni to Ronjok to help her cleanse the demons from her dreams.  The mission is to defend the village against [[Margonite]]s and [[Harbinger of Twilight|Harbingers of Twilight]] and once done go on to defeat the [[Harbinger of Nightfall]].
  
  ''Nundu Bay'' is a mission which represents a branch in the storyline. Only one of either this mission or, the other view of the story, [[Jennur's Horde (Mission)|Jennur's Horde]] needs to be completed.  Nundu Bay is generally the preferred option to Jennur's Horde as it is a simpler mission to accomplish.
  
  ==Mission information==
  
  ===Requirements===
  Melonni must be in your party to enter the mission.
  
  ===Objectives===
  Defeat the Harbingers of Nightfall before they can destroy the village of Ronjok.
  *The Harbingers of Nightfall can only be damaged once they are affected by the purified water of the vials.
  *Protect and defend [[Elder Jonah]].  He must survive.
  *'''Bonus''' Defeat the additional Harbingers.
  
  ===Reward===
  In this mission, the rewards are based on whether you defeat any of the additional Harbingers of Twilight.
  {{Mission reward
  | objective = Harbingers defeated
  | standard = 0
  | expert = 1
  | master = 2 }}
  
  ==Walkthrough==
  
  You start in the village(1 on the map), after some dialog you will be told that the only way in which the Harbingers may take any damage is by ensuring they have purified holy water on them and Elder Johan has some.  Don't talk to Elder Jonah just yet, instead kill some of the [[Margonite]] groups from around the village and up as far as the location where the Harbinger of Nightfall will spawn.  Doing this will make the fight to defend the village much easier.
  
  Once you've cleared the Margonites you can speak with Elder Jonah to receive the vials of purified water a [[Hex Spell]] which you equip.  Taking the purified water is the trigger for additional Margonite forces to spawn and begin attacking the village.  
  
  There are several waves of Margonites, starting at groups of two, increasing to groups of six which approach the village attacking through alternating entrances.  The last group of the first wave will be led by the Monk boss [[Priest Zein Zuu]].  When he has been defeated, a [[Harbinger of Twilight]] will spawn.  From close range use the [[projectile]] vial of purified water against it to ensure you're doing damage and dispatch it.  After that, a group led by Paragon boss [[Commander Chutal]], then a group led by Elementalist boss [[Scribe Wensai]] will attack.  Another Harbinger of Twilight will spawn next, and finally a group led by [[Zealot Sheoli]].  Once he is defeated you are free to travel out of the village to the old Kournan fort because there are no more groups which might come and kill Elder Jonah.
  
  Kill the groups of Margonites up to the Harbinger of Nightfall(at 2). The Harbingers ARE attached to the groups around them, so beware when pulling. Try killing everything around the harbingers before directing attention to the Harbinger itself. As the Harbinger of Nightfall becomes weaker, he will summon two groups of Margonites. Destroy the Harbinger of Nightfall the same way you killed the Harbingers of Twilight to complete the mission.
  
  ===Bonus===
  The bonus is to kill additional Harbingers of Twilight.  These are located inside the Kournan fort surrounded by Margonites, to the south of where the Harbinger of Nightfall spawns.  You will need the vials of purified water to defeat these, so you must complete the siege on the village first. 
  
  If you leave the fort through the middle of the three exits you will walk up a ditch of sorts to where the Harbinger of Nightfall spawns.  Before you get to it there will be places where you can leave the ditch to  go south-east.  Leave the ditch before you get to Harbinger of Nightfall and travel up the hill towards the top of the fort.  The first Harbinger is at the entrance to the fort area, kill it like the other Harbingers using the vials of purified water.  The second is located further into the fort.  Backtrack to head north once both have been dispatched to kill the Harbinger of Nightfall to complete the mission.
  
  ===Skill recommendations===
  *One or two members of the party need to have space for the [[Vial of Purified Water]] skill.
  Note: Adventurers with a pet can replace their Charm Animal skill with Vial of Purified Water and still control their pet companion.
  when trying to kill the harbringer of nightfall,flag your heros at the top of the hill.then do the crazy horse tactic of drawing him to your group.after he spawns he will retire back down the hill leaving u to defeat his forces.repeat this tactic then attack.

  In recent years, [[Varesh Ossa|Varesh]] has spent more time with [[General Kahyet|Kahyet]] than her other generals. For decades, [[General Kahyet]] has served faithfully as the [[Dervish]] mentor of Varesh. At seventy years old, she has endless stories of the history of early [[Elona]]. Although she is still an effective commander, her health is failing. Many [[Kourna]]ns take comfort in knowing that Kahyet\xE2\x80\x99s insights and wisdom might live on in their warmarshal.\n\n\
  Kahyet has served as a teacher and guardian to Varesh Ossa for years, assisting her in her studies of the principles of [[Ascension]], Dervish philosophy, the Elonian gods, the history of [[Turai Ossa]], and more esoteric lore. When she learned that Varesh was following the same spiritual path as her ancestor, Kahyet guided her on the path, inspiring her with secrets that only a few truly understand. Kahyet\xE2\x80\x99s time may be running out, but she knows that an era of greatness is at hand.\n\n\

  Stone Pedestal\n\
  :''\"Three hundred years ago, when the thriving Canthan port of Dinfang was invaded by the people then known only as \"naitahlen\" or \"pirates,\" the Canthan Army sent a small force stationed at nearby Fort Fu to put down what they saw as nothing more than a pack of rabid dogs. When young Kitah arrived with her troops, she discovered that an organized invasion was underway, led by the naitahlen admiral, Appollonia. Severely outnumbered and out-gunned, the Mesmer created a cloud of illusion that made her squadron appear to double in size, then redouble, then redouble again until her force appeared a great army. As she ordered the charge, the naitahlen scattered in terror, many running into the sea and drowning themselves. In the midst of the chaos, Kitah found Appollonia, a Warrior, and the two fought until both fell down dead on the battlefield. Dinfang was ultimately saved, and Kitah inducted into Tahnnakai Temple.\"''\n\n\

  The [[Survivor]] title track is one of the more frustrating and nerve-wracking titles to pursue. The tiers in this title are all earned by achieving a certain amount of [[experience]] without dying even once.\n\n\
  ==Survivor title track==\n\
  :{| {{STDT}}\n\
  ! Tier !! Title !! Experience gained without dying !! Average time (sample size)\n\
  |- align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"\n\
  | '''1''' || '''Survivor''' || '''140,600''' || 11 hours (N)\n\

  |- align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"\n\
  | 3 || Legendary Survivor || 1,337,500 || 65 hours (N=7)\n\
  |}\n\n\
  ==Acquisition==\n\
  Your [[character]] must ''not'' die if you wish to progress in this title track. A single death will halt its progress for that character permanently and irrevocably. Type \"/deaths\" in the in-game chat to run the command that checks the number of deaths your current character has suffered. If the command reports anything other than 0 deaths, this title track is no longer active.\n\n\
  If the character dies after achieving at least tier 1, the title track will still be visible and the title can still be displayed, but it will not progress any further. It will remain at the amount of experience the character had when the first death was accrued.\n\n\
  ===Types of deaths===\n\
  Not all deaths are counted as deaths by \"/deaths\" command. The following circumstances '''''will not''''' affect the progress of Survivor:\n\
  *Programmed cutscene deaths (be wary of [[necromancer]] [[minion]]s turning hostile).\n\
  *Triggered deaths during the [[Factions]] and [[Nightfall]] tutorial [[quest]]s.\n\
  *Deaths due to [[mission]] failure or resignation (the \"/resign\" command).\n\
  *Instant death mechanics (such as the crushing traps in [[Fahranur, The First City|Fahranur]] and [[Sorrow's Furnace]], the [[Sulfurous Haze]] [[environmental effect]], and skill triggers like [[Death Pact Signet]]).\n\
  *Dying in [[town]]s and [[outpost]]s (i.e. non-instanced areas). Examples include the triggered deaths during [[Halloween]] events or dying from damage during mini-events like the [[Mursaat Rally]].\n\
  *Dying in certain special event [[PvP]] contests such as the [[Dragon Arena]].\n\n\
  The following circumstances will cause you to incur a death and '''''will''''' halt your Survivor progress:\n\
  *Dying from losing all health from [[damage]] or [[sacrifice]] (includes deaths during [[PvP]])\n\
  *Deaths accrued while in a state of disconnection (when connection is lost, but you are still logged in).\n\
  *Your [[Junundu]] losing all health ([[Nightfall]]-only).\n\n\
  ===Useful tips===\n\
  * '''Planning'''\n\
  ** If possible, decide early if you desire to achieve this goal.  Planning your progression throughout the game will help immensely on where you can easily rack up experience points.  Things such as marking areas, missions, quests, and bosses that are considered high-risk will help on minimizing the chance of dying.\n\
  ** Aim to complete the [[Augury Rock]] mission in [[Tyria]] before completing the quest [[Hunted!]] in [[Elona]] or the mission [[Nahpui Quarter]] in [[Cantha]] - you will receive 50,000 XP for completing Augury Rock if it is your first [[Ascension]]-equivalent accomplishment.\n\
  ** Get yourself run through dangerous areas either early on, or not at all.\n\
  * '''Where to find XP'''\n\
  ** Capturing elite skills with [[Signet of Capture|Signets of Capture]], worth 5,000XP each at level 20.\n\
  ** The Factions quests [[Raze the Roost]] and [[Befriending the Luxons]]/[[Befriending the Kurzicks]], each worth 10,000XP.\n\
  ** Combine with other titles or with farming, such as faction farming, [[Sunspear rank]]s, etc.\n\
  ** The quest [[Summit Slaves]] in [[Sorrow's Furnace]] is the fastest repeatable source of experience available to player with access to Prophecies campaign (approximately 22,500 experience per hour).\n\
  ** The quest [[The Jade Arena]] in [[Archipelagos]], southeast of [[Breaker Hollow]] is the fastest repeatable source of experience available to player with access to Faction campaign (approximately 40,000 experience per hour).\n\
  * '''Character build'''\n\
  ** Aim for a combination of high armor and ranged attacks or effects, e.g. ranger and paragon primaries are recommended. \n\
  ** Aim for a support role: healing, condition removal, and buffs are non-threatening to enemies, thus you are less of a target for them. It also allows you to help your team without necessarily going into aggro range yourself. \n\
  ** Include a skill for running if possible.\n\
  ** Include an emergency skill that will either keep you alive long enough to map out of the area if things turn ugly, or just help you long enough to cause whatever is targeting you to target someone else. Some examples are [[Endure Pain]], [[Shadow Form]], [[Whirling Defense]], [[Shield Stance]], [[Obsidian Flesh]], [[Mark of Protection]], [[Feigned Neutrality]], and [[Healing Hands]].\n\
  ** Always include a self-heal of some form, just in case the healers are dead, dazed, or otherwise occupied.\n\
  ** Get high [[health]] by using Survivor's [[insignia]], [[Rune]]s of Vigor/Vitae and [[weapon upgrade]]s of Fortitude. A high health not only improves your general survivability, but also makes you a less desirable target for the monster AI.\n\
  * '''Party'''\n\
  ** Ask your friends to help out. Guild and alliance members are much more understanding of your goal and will tolerate sudden departures in mid-play. Playing in Pick-Up Groups ([[PUG]]) is much more risky as the teamwork may not gel as well as those from guild and alliance members.\n\
  ** When progressing on this title alone, consider using Henchmen and/or Heroes over joining a PUG. When adventuring alone with [[Hero]]es and [[Henchman|Henchmen]], you are free to use your escape method at any given time, as you are the only human player in the game.\n\
  ** If one must go with a PUG, it is recommended to advise the party members of your goal and intention.  It lets the party members and party leader decide if they wish to have you aboard.  Some may not tolerate sudden departures in mid-play when a massive battle is taking place.  And this will give the party a fair enough warning to decide on keeping you around. Keep in mind that some people will deliberately try to get you killed to foil your attempt at the title, so keep an eye out for trouble.\n\
  ** Be more defensive than aggressive. It is easier to recognize and react to a losing fight if it is drawn out.\n\
  * '''Using Heroes and Henchmen'''\n\
  ** Learn to control them. Use [[call|target calling]] to tell them to attack your target without attacking it yourself, which is important to stay out of the frontlines. \n\
  ** When fighting AoE-heavy enemies, spread your heroes around using the flags. \n\
  * '''Maximizing your runs'''\n\
  ** Use XP gained from monster kills to your advantage.  Every point counts no matter how little it gives you. Consider using XP [[scroll]]s in areas where monsters are plentiful.\n\
  ** Hold off on using the Signet of Capture until you are at level 20. This way, each elite skill capture is worth 5,000XP. This is one of the quickest method of advancing in the title.\n\
  * '''Strategy'''\n\
  ** Have an escape plan ready to execute when the situation worsens. A Logout key or warping to an outpost, town, or Guild Hall is the most common method of escaping from scenarios where the battle outcome may not be in your favor. Do note, however, that latency between the server and your computer (also known as lag) can spike, causing the server to believe you are still in the area taking damage. It is not a foolproof method to escape and cheat death and one should refer to the above tip about planning ahead and marking high-risk (dangerous) areas.\n\
  ** Draw the enemies to you using bows, especially if they lay traps. \n\
  ** It is often preferable to kill nearby enemies first (warriors / assassins) rather than rush through to the monks and other squishies.\n\
  ** Take less risks. Avoid rushing for master's rewards, pull back and regroup if your party is taking too much damage.\n\
  * '''Bugged Cinematics'''\n\
  ** It is very important to note that you can die during certain mission cinematics, most notably the one at the end of [[Vizunah Square]]. These bugs are caused by unbound minions present during the cinematic. In [[Vizunah Square]], the cutscene forces minion masters to lose control of their minions due to the mechanics of the cutscene, which will then kill some of the party.\n\
  ** To avoid such deaths, either skip a cutscene the moment you see you are being attacked by minions, or close Guildwars if someone in the party is not skipping. In the case of Vizunah Square, simply closing Guildwars the moment you receive experience for the mission is the safest course of action.\n\
  **In Prophecies chapter, in order to cross over from pre-searing you must go through a type of trial PvP arena. To avoid deaths in this arena (since levels can span from 1-15 or higher) Simply log out while waiting to go into battle. Once you log back in, you should be in the latter stages fighting grawl and charr with your party. In this situation you can simply hang back and strike from a distance or just wait for your party members to vanquish the area.\n\n\
  ===Case studies===\n\
  *This timeline is based on one attempt, and meant to give an idea of the work involved in completing this title track. It was accomplished with a [[paragon]] ([[mesmer]] and [[monk]] secondary professions) using only [[henchmen]] and [[hero]]es:\n\
  **Survivor (1) is achieved at level 20 (all quests in [[Istan]] plus a few in [[Kaineng Center]]).\n\
  **Indomitable Survivor (2) can be achieved in a total of 52 hours of play (all quests in Istan, all quests in Kaineng Center and [[the Marketplace]], all missions from [[Lion's Arch]] to [[Augury Rock]], all missions and quests up to the [[Bone Palace]], in addition of capturing 15 [[elite skill]]s).\n\
  **Legendary Survivor (3) can be achieved in 102 hours of play (most quests and missions prior to [[Unwaking Waters]], most quests and missions prior to [[Ruins of Morah]], most quests and missions up to [[Droknar's Forge]] as well as some [[Sorrow's Furnace]] quests and some repeatable quests in Factions).\n\n\
  *Legendary Survivor (3) has been earned on a [[warrior]], a [[ranger]], and a [[mesmer]] in 125 hours (without Nightfall), 52 hours, and 64 hours, respectively. For each, complete most missions with Master's, complete most quests, and capture between 50-100 elite skills. No scrolls or repeatable quests were used.\n\n\
  *Legendary Survivor (3) has been earned on a [[mesmer]] in 52 hours using only the Nightfall Campaign. It was done by farming insects outside [[Yohlon Haven]] on hard mode with 3 heroes. [[Scroll of Rampager's Insight]] were used to speed up the progress.\n\n\
  *Legendary Survivor (3) has been earned on a [[ranger]] in 36 hours using only the Nightfall Campaign (with the exception of skills for other builds).  It was done by farming the [[Battle of Turai's Procession]] quest with a R/Rt Splinter/Barrage build on Normal Mode with Insight Scrolls.\n\n\
  *Legendary Survivor (3) has been earned on a [[dervish]] in 26 hours using only the Nightfall campaign. Using [[Life Barrier]], [[Life Bond]] and [[Balthazar's Aura]] on [[Tahlkora]], and [[Mystic Regeneration]] and [[Stoneflesh Aura]] on the dervish (other six skills can be chosen freely). After reaching Level 20 in Istan, spiders outside [[Sunspear Great Hall]] were farmed in hard mode. Gold experience scrolls were used to speed up the process.\n\n\
  ==Notes==\n\
  *This title track will only appear on the [[Hero Panel]] upon attaining [[level]] 5 with zero deaths. If the character has died prior to reaching level 5, this title track will not appear.\n\
  *The Survivor title track is thought to be mutually exclusive with the [[Defender of Ascalon]] title by many. This is due to the \"death leveling\" strategy used to acquire the latter title. Currently, it appears that revived pets and minions do not give experience, and as such those cannot be used to death level monsters."

  ==Walkthrough==\n\
  This is best accomplished by departing from Sardelac Sanitarium.  Head southeast through the debris down to the dry riverbed.  You'll find a couple groups of Grawl with a boss or two.  Take them out a group at a time (take out the Grawl Ulodytes first if possible).  Once you've cleared the Grawl, head northeast and then make a sharp turn southeast.  (In pre-Searing Ascalon, a bridge used to cross the river here.)  Take out the Gargoyles and any Devourers that pop up, and follow the path southeast to the Regent Valley Exit (near point '''B''').\n\n\
  In Regent Valley, take a few steps towards Sergeant Clark (point '''A''').  After you speak with him, he'll tell his unit to fall in behind you.  Go back into Old Ascalon.\n\n\
  Once you're back in Old Ascalon, approach Sergeant Clark and the three Ascalon Guards (again, point '''B''').  They'll follow you after you approach them.  Head back the way you came (going northwest away from point '''B'''), but once you reach the dry riverbed start walking northeast.  You'll encounter a few scattered groups of Gargoyles and Devourers along the way to point '''C'''.  You shouldn't have any problems dispatching the Gargoyles or the Devourers as you make your way back to Warmaster Grast.  Once you and the patrol reach point '''C''', speak to Grast to receive your reward.\n\n\
  ==Dialogue==\n\n\
  ===Initial dialogue===\n\
  '''Warmaster Grast'''\n\
  :''\"We have something of a mlitary emergency taking place.  When Barradin and his Vanguard broke through the Charr lines to Piken Square, they created a weak point in their own line.  Our scouts report that Charr forces are massing to try to break through the Breach, and we've not enough men in place to stop them.  We need to reassign our forces quickly!\n\n\
  :''If you are willing, I'd like you to gather up a patrol that has been watching the road in '''Regent Valley'''.  The patrol leader is '''Sergeant Clark'''.  I'll need you to bring him and his men back to me for reassignment.  What say you?\"''\n\
  :'''Accept:''' ''\"You can count on me, sir!\"''\n\
  :'''Decline:''' ''\"I respectfully decline.\"''\n\
  :'''When asked about quest:''' ''\"What are you still doing here?  Find '''Clark''' and his men in '''Regent Valley''' and bring them to me for reassignment.\"''\n\n\
  ===Intermediate dialogue===\n\
  :'''Sergeant Clark:''' ''\"Warmaster Grast orders us to report to him?  Lead the way!  I know better than to disappoint the Warmaster again.  I still haven't recovered from the last time.\"''\n\
  :'''NPC name:''' ''\"Men, prepare to move out!  Fall in line behind '''[Player Name]'''!\"''\n\n\
  ===Reward dialogue===\n\
  '''Warmaster Grast'''\n\
  :''\"The patrol!  Well done!  You are a credit to Ascalon, '''[Player Name]'''.  Clark, take your men, head in to Ascalon City, and gather as many able-bodied fighters as you can!\"''\n\n\

  The [[Master of Whispers]] is one of the [[hero]]es available in [[Guild Wars Nightfall]]. The Master of Whispers is a man of mysteries, his true name unspoken, his motives unrevealed. You, however, are instrumental to his plans. He is the leader of the [[Order of Whispers]].\n\n\

This cryptic figure is so mysterious that he's hidden his real name; instead, he's always addressed by his title. The Master of Whispers has unquestioned command of an [[Order of Whispers|efficient organization]], although many debate what form his authority actually takes. One rumor holds that he's the province's spymaster, keeping a job where he serves as a central collector of information from spies across the nation (and perhaps beyond). Others believe he deals with supernatural threats, training his agents as ghost seekers and demon hunters. Whatever the truth may be, he often finds reason for traveling with adventurers exploring Elona (and perhaps beyond). His reasons for doing so are strictly on a need-to-know basis.

The Shadow Nexus: |-
  {{mission-stub}}
  {{Location disambiguation|The Shadow Nexus}}
  {{Mission infobox
  | name = The Shadow Nexus
  | campaign = Nightfall
  | region = Realm of Torment
  | type = Challenge
  | partysize = 4
  | duration = Medium
  }}
  '''The Shadow Nexus''' is a 4-person [[Challenge Mission]]. The goal in this mission is to close the Torment Rifts before a hole is torn in the dimensional fabric. This is done by killing the [[Margonite]] [[Portal Mage]]s that guard each rift.  As long as a rift stays open, the rift progress bar will continue to fill (one pip per open rift). Once it is full, the mission will end.  
  
  Initially, each portal mage will be guarded by 2 enemies.  As the mission progresses, more enemies will accompany them, making subsequent battles more difficult. You receive 10 points for killing portal mages and 1 point for all other enemies.
  
  ==Rewards==
  [[Mysterious Armor Piece]]s are awarded randomly to players in the party when Portal Mages are killed. Note that these items do not drop in the normal way, they simply appear in a player's inventory.
  
  If the inventory is full, the armor pieces drops on the ground, so please make sure you have at least one empty slot in your inventory before entering.
  
  [[Mysterious Armor Piece]]s can be used to upgrade the visual appearance of hero armor to the hero version of "[[Ancient Armor]]".  (Note that the hero version looks different from the player version.) This upgrade is available for [[Zenmai]], [[Olias]], [[Norgu]], [[Goren]] or [[General Morgahn]].
  
  ==Tactics==
  * The "U" map shows the location of all the potential rifts with gray flags (similar to the [[Alliance Battle]] map).  An open rift shows as a red flag.  Use this to optimize your path to the next open rift.
  * Like most challenge missions, speed buffs are very important to get to the next rift quickly.
  * The portal mages are not only in charge of the rifts, but they are also powerful elementalists, so it's important to kill them as quickly as possible.  Although the other creatures around the rift don't have to be killed, they will remain and make it harder the next time a rift opens at that location.
  * There are a number of skills that can prove useful in mitigating damage, which is very important as you only have a 4 man party. Monks should consider taking [[Protective Spirit]]/[[Spirit Bond]], [[Life Sheath]] is also useful to prevent mage's damage, Mesmers should consider [[Elemental Resistance]]/[[Mantra of Lightning]], Ritualists should consider taking [[Shelter]]/[[Union]] for party wide protection over a large chunk of the area (the Rifts are quite close together) and bringing a paragon with [["Incoming!"]], [[Song of Restoration]] or [[Ballad of Restoration]] could also help.
  * [[Interrupt]]s are ''very'' important in this mission, as preventing the damage is much easier than healing it. Rangers should consider taking [[Broad Head Arrow]] and [[Needling Shot]] with them to keep the Portal Mage shut down. [[Savage Shot]] and [[Distracting Shot]] also work well
  * Characters with a mesmer secondary (especially [[hero]]es, due to their insane interrupting ability) should consider taking [[Power Drain]] for an interrupt and energy management.
  * The monsters / [[mob]] in the rift are not in the same group, so you should consider killing them separately.

  ''Kuonghsang was a wizened old sage who spent his days dispensing helpful advice and delivering messages to and from the spirit realm. When the emperor's daughter took sick with an unknown illness, Kuonghsang consulted with the spirits. After gathering their advice, he returned to his emperor's side, relaying all that he had learned. Convinced of Kuongsang's advice, the emperor ordered the death of the oldest daughter of every household, and when it was done, he looked to his own daughter, sure she would be healthy once more. Instead, he found her cold body lying in her bed. It did not take Kuongsang long to realize he had misinterpreted the riddles of the spirits. In grief and shame, he took the emperor's sword and cut off his own head.''

  * Spirit Bond and [[Protective Spirit]] stack to great effect.  If a target with 500 health has both Spirit Bond and Protective Spirit on him and takes 100 damage, the damage will be reduced to 50 and he will receive the healing from Spirit Bond.
  * To trigger Spirit Bond, each [[damage|damage source]] must do over 60 damage.  One hits with multiple damage source that total more than 60 will not trigger Spirit Bond.  An example would be a ranger using [[Kindle Arrows]] with [[Dual Shot]] to do a total damage of 100, but with 20 and 30 damage from each source.
  * Skills that lower your health by more than 60 but are not [[damage]] do not trigger SB.  This includes like steal (blood spike), deep wound, and so on.

  *In Latin, ''evirso'' is derived from ''eviro'', which means to unman or to emasculate. ''sectus'' is derived from ''seco'', which means to cut, to separate or to dismember. ''Evirso Sectus'' translates roughly into "an emasculated separated one" or maybe "i unman the dismembered". A translation more accurate to the meaning would be "one who divides and conquers" or, even better, "I divide and conquer".

  ==Dunham, Enchanter Henchman==\n\
  '''Profession:''' Enchanter ([[Mesmer]])<br>\n\
  '''Armament:''' [[Staff]]\n\n\
  Available for hire as a henchman from [[Yak's Bend]] onwards.\n\n\
  ==Location==\n\
  *[[Shiverpeak Mountains]]\n\
  *[[Kryta]]\n\
  *[[Maguuma Jungle]]\n\
  *[[Crystal Desert]]\n\
  *[[Ring of Fire Islands]]\n\n\
  ==Skills used==\n\
  *{{skill icon|Distortion}}\n\
  *{{skill icon|Drain Enchantment}}\n\
  *{{skill icon|Empathy}}\n\
  *{{skill icon|Imagined Burden}}\n\
  *{{skill icon|Resurrection Signet}}\n\
  *{{skill icon|Shatter Hex}}\n\n\
  From [[The Dragon's Lair]] on:\n\
  *{{skill icon|Crippling Anguish}} ([[Elite]]) (replaces Imagined Burden)\n\n\
  ==Evaluation==\n\
  With his [[hex]]es, he tends to be a priority target of enemy monster groups (more so than [[Orion]], [[Alesia]], or [[Claude]]). You can use this as a distraction or as a trap. Since most of the strongest mesmer skills require a human's intuition, timing, and strategy, some players feel he is somewhat less effective than the other henchmen.\n\n\
  '''Pros'''\n\
  *Has [[Empathy]], an excellent damage dealing spell against computer-controlled opponents.\n\
  *He is good at slowing down enemy [[warrior]]s. The combination of slowing, [[Empathy]], and his own [[Distortion]] allows him to tank quite well against one or two hard-hitting [[ranger]]/[[melee]] enemies despite having regular caster [[armor]]. By no means is this anywhere near enough when getting swarmed, but he can take hits from a warrior or two.\n\
  *He is the only henchman who can drain [[enchantment|enchantments]] from enemies and shatter [[hex|hexes]] on allies. These skills are very useful against enemy [[mesmer|mesmers]], [[necromancer|necromancers]] and [[monk|monks]].\n\
  *[[Crippling Anguish]] is used often once he gets it (Dragon's Lair onwards); it is quite helpful, and much more effective than [[Imagined Burden]].\n\
  *Dunham's skills deal armor-ignoring damage.\n\
  '''Cons'''\n\
  *The only henchman who does not have some form of health recovery skill, even though [[Ether Feast]] is a skill available to players from [[pre-Searing]].\n\
  *He tends to use Imagined Burden often, which is not terribly useful overall in [[PvE]]. Sometimes he even casts it on stationary targets such as [[Dune Burrower]]s.\n\
  *He tends to use Distortion frequently, even when not under direct attack. \n\
  *He is not a [[Shutdown Mesmer]]. He will not [[interrupt]] enemy spells nor drain enemy spellcasters' energy.\n\
  *[[Shatter Hex]] and [[Drain Enchantment]] are not used in an effective manner. Dunham will cast them seemingly at random instead of saving them for vital cases such as [[Spiteful Spirit]] or [[Mark of Protection]], for example.\n\
  *[[Empathy]] is not very useful against caster enemies.\n\
  *He is most enemy spellcasters' #1 target, and he dies fairly quickly. Because of mounting [[Death Penalty]] and the fact that he's often constantly being attacked, he can quickly become a hindrance.\n\n\

  ==Walkthrough==\n\
  If you came from Ascalon City by the path on the hill, you've already cleared the path out and the quest is quite easy.  There will be one extra spawn of devourers near the city.  Even if you don't clear the path first, just try to keep the monsters off Farmer Hamnet.\n\n\
  Hamnet doesn't become an ally in the party window, but keeps himself alive with [[Heal Area]].  This could be annoying because it will heal adjacent monsters as well.\n\n\
  Remember, as with all other \"escort NPC[s] to town\" quests, to come close to the portal but not enter it.  Wait for Hamnet to come near and the quest to update.  Then return to Grazden and tell him Hamnet made it to town safely.\n\n\

  Locate and defeat [[Kanaxai]].
  
  ==Mission information==
  
  ===Requirements===
  Access to [[Cavalon]].
  
  ===Objectives===
  *Find and destroy the source of the [[Luxon]] [[outcast]]s and [[Oni]].
  
  ==Walkthrough==
  
  ===Overview===
  The entire mission area is divided into thirteen different sections, all of them having one or more [[environment effect]]s active. The environment effects persist until their respective Aspect of Kanaxai in that section is defeated. Obviously, taking down the Aspect of Kanaxai fast and early helps (but don't overdo it). The first and last section do not have Aspects of Kanaxai, while the second section has four. Kanaxai himself is in the last section.
  
  Bear in mind that this mission will take at least 2 hours to complete with a very experienced group, but it is more likely to take around 3-4 hours. The key is to take things slowly and carefully, to prevent being caught off-guard. It is a bad idea to try to rush through this mission as [[sweeping]] in certain later sections is required, with large numbers of large hidden mobs.
  
  Due to large mobs, skills that do area damage are very useful and essential to bring ([[Searing Flames]], [[Meteor Shower]], [[Spiteful Spirit]], [[trap]]s, etc.). Similarly, [[party]]-wide protection and healing spells like [[Aegis]], [[ward]]s, [[Heal Party]], and [[Light of Deliverance]] are extremely useful, since they affect twelve party members at once.
  
  [[Rebirth]] is required at one point of the mission, as some members of the party must be rebirthed to get them past a locked gate (the alternative takes much longer and significantly more difficult, making it much less preferable). The [[necromancer]] [[energy regeneration]] of [[Blood Ritual]] and [[Blood is Power]] is very valuable to monks, since it lets them use [[Heal Party]] more often.
  
  ===Section 1 (exhaustion)===
  ; ''[[Aspect of Exhaustion]]'' : ''While under this aspect, you suffer from [[exhaustion]] every 30 seconds.''
  
  This is the arrival room. The party must split into four groups of three. Each group needs to enter through one of four different portals and take out an Aspect of Kanaxai. Plan the grouping and subsequent strategy for the next section before starting the mission; you should not linger in this section for long.
  
  ===Section 2 (four separate effects)===
  ; ''[[Aspect of Exposure]]'' (left portal) : ''While under this aspect, you cannot "[[block]]" attacks.''
  ; ''[[Aspect of Surrender]]'' (middle-left portal) : ''When under this aspect, whenever you are struck by an attack, you are [[knockdown|knocked down]].''
  ; ''[[Aspect of Death]]'' (middle-right portal) : ''While under this aspect, you receive 20% less benefit from healing.''
  ; ''[[Aspect of Soothing]]'' (right portal) : ''While under this aspect, it takes you twice as long to gain [[adrenaline]].''
  
  In general, [[Riposte]] is a good skill against the Aspects of Kanaxai because they only use [[melee]] attacks. When an Aspect of Kanaxai is defeated, the exit door out of that small room will open, granting access to the next section, as well as leading to the locked doors of the other small rooms. Large numbers of enemies will stand between each exit, requiring careful [[pull]]ing, or attempt to run through the mobs. See the next section regarding another method of opening the locked doors.
  
  The room beyond the left portal should have a good [[Protection Prayers|protection]] [[monk]], although powerful [[Healing Prayers|healing]] would still be fine.
  
  Skills like [[Dolyak Signet]], [[Balanced Stance]], and [[Ward of Stability]] is very helpful for the middle-left room.
  
  Powerful healing plus strong [[health regeneration]] is necessary for the middle-right room.
  
  The room from the rightmost portal will be easier if the primary source damage comes from [[energy]]-based attacks and casters.
  
  === Section 3 (health degeneration) ===
  ; ''[[Aspect of Pain]]'' : ''While under this aspect, you suffer -2 [[Health degeneration]] and suffer from the effects of [[Deep Wound]].''
  
  This room is filled with [[Ripper Carp]]s, [[Scourge Manta]]s, [[Blessed Manta]]s and [[Darkened Irukandji]]. The party should watch out for the Irukandji's [[Restoration]] spirits, since they can [[resurrect]]. They patrol in several groups with tight patrols. A bad pull will result in a huge [[aggro]]. Party-wide healing skills like [[Heal Party]] and [[Recuperation]] are very useful here.
  
  The groups that managed to kill their Aspect of Kanaxai and entered this section could attempt to clear out this section. Once the [[Kanaxai Aspect of Pain]] here is killed, any doors to the previous rooms that are still locked will be unlocked, allowing the rest of the party to go in and help the remaining groups that were unable to break out. Regroup and recuperate before proceeding to the next section.
  
  ===Section 4 (slowed movement)===
  ; ''[[Aspect of Lethargy]]'' : ''While under this aspect, you move 50% slower.''
  
  This room is filled with different kinds of [[Leviathan Fish]]. The party [[tank]]s can form a wall on the left side and pull the first group. Block the [[Leviathan Arm]]s and take out the [[Leviathan Mind]]s and [[Leviathan Head]]s first. Repeat this with the center group and the right group as well. Casters should be wary of [[Choking Gas]] used by the Leviathan Heads. Warriors with [["Charge!"]] or [[Sprint]] can counteract the environment effect. Once the mobs are cleared, the party can take out the [[Kanaxai Aspect of Lethargy]].
  
  After clearing this section, look around for square, wooden boards spread out close to the next gate (which leads to the next section). If there is one character standing on each of them, the gate will open. The moment any of those standing on the boards step off, the gate will close. It closes too fast for the these characters to run through. As such, these five characters must be left behind as the other seven head into the next section.
  
  It is ''very'' important to note the following: immediately after the seven has gone through the gate, the remaining five must quickly run up to the gate and stand right next to it. This is because once the seven reaches a certain point past the gate (usually after clearing two groups of [[Outcast]]s), a very large mob of [[Sapping Nightmare]]s and [[Freezing Nightmare]]s will spawn in the corners of this section and head towards the gate. The five characters left behind will almost certainly die. Sicne they will all die by the gate, it is easy for the seven beyond the gate to use [[Rebirth]] and bring the dead ones across. [[Recall]] will save you from dying if you are an [[assassin]].
  
  Note that it ''is'' possible to kill all the spawned nightmares, since the seven can come back to the gate and support the five. Killing all the nightmares will open the gate permanently. This is mostly considered pointless by many, since the sheer number of enemies in this mission and their high levels will easily remove the [[death penalty]] incurred.
  
  ===Section 5 (energy loss)===
  ; ''[[Aspect of Depletion]]'' : ''While under this aspect, every 30 seconds, you lose 10 [[Energy]] and take 8 points of [[damage]] for every point of Energy lost this way.''
  
  There are quite a few Outcast mobs in this section. As mentioned in the previous section, the first two or three groups would have been taken out already. Careful use and management of energy is very important here, especially for monks. When engaging these Outcasts, casters should watch out for [[Maelstrom]]. Also, avoid standing near corpses if possible, since [[Outcast Deathhand]]s has the skill [[Putrid Explosion]].
  
  When [[Kanaxai Aspect of Depletion]] can be reached, pull it away from the remaining three or so mobs and take it down. Then proceed to clear the rest of the mobs to clear this section.
  
  ===Section 6 (no spells)===
  ; ''[[Aspect of Failure]]'' : ''While under this aspect, all of your [[spell]]s fail.''
  
  This section renders casters almost useless. The key to clearing this section is to ''stay outside of it''. Tanks in the party need to set up a wall at the gate into the section. Any [[trapper]]s should stay behind them and trap the gate area. Casters should stay behind the walls on both sides.
  
  Designate one of the tanks to go in and pull the mobs to the gate. Since [[Outcast Reaver]]s use [["Charge!"]], they are easy to pull. Block them at the gate and take them down. Repeat this for all the mobs that can be pulled (leaving some [[Outcast Raider]]s and the [[Kanaxai Aspect of Failure]]).
  
  At this point, the party can actually choose to ignore this Aspect of Kanaxai and head into the next section (killing it is not required). This usually depends on whether a [[chest]] has spawned amongst the Outcast Raiders on the higher platforms. If there is one, the party would need to run into the area and past the enemies to right before the stairways down. There is a corner there where the environment effect is not active, allowing casters to function normally. Pull the Aspect Kanaxai down to that area and kill it. The remaining Raiders are easily killed once the environment effect is lifted.
  
  ===Section 7 (no enchantments)===
  ; ''[[Aspect of Shadows]]'' : ''While under this aspect, you cannot use [[enchantment]]s or be targeted by [[enchantment]]s.''
  
  [[Sweep]]ing this section is absolutely essential. There are many [[Oni of the Deep]] popups here. Due to the environment effect, strong healing skills are essential.
  
  The central area of this section has [[the Leviathan]] seemingly trapped in jade. As the party closes in, it breaks free and starts attacking. Ignore both the Leviathan and the surrounding [[Reborn Irukandji]] and their [[Disenchantment]] [[spirit]]s. These Irukandji respawn quickly and indefinitely when killed. There is another groups of Oni popups that lie just past the Leviathan. Before engaging that group, make sure to stay outside the range of the Leviathan's attacks as the combined damage easily overwhelms the healing capabilities of monks in the party (as no enchantments are possible).
  
  The [[Kanaxai Aspect of Shadows]] stands past the previous group of Oni. Killing it will ease the difficulty of this section. Killing the Leviathan is now possible (although there's no really no reason to). There is one more large group of Oni before the next set of stairway down.
  
  At the top of that stairway, there is a single Reborn Irukandji. Do ''not'' kill it (or if it is dead, wait for it to respawn before continuing). This Irukdanji makes the next section easier.
  
  ===Section 8 (teleport and knockdown)===
  ; ''[[Scorpion Aspect]]'' : ''While under this aspect, every 30 seconds, you are [[teleport]]ed to the nearest foe and [[Knockdown|knocked down]].''
  
  The sudden teleport makes this section one of more difficult sections in the Deep, due to the confusion it causes. The environment effect here is the sole reason to keep the Irukandji at the top of the stairs alive. Since the effect teleports a character to the nearest foe, by staying nearer to the Irukandji than the mobs below, party members will not suddenly find themselves in the midst of a large mob. Party-wide healing are again very important here.
  
  {{bug|The actual environment effect does not match the description. The teleport and knockdown effect occurs about every 5 seconds.}}
  
  The first part of this section should be cleared with most of the party at the top of the stairs. One puller needs to sweep the bottom of the stairs for hidden groups of Oni of the Deep. There are several groups, with some spawning some distance from the stairs. The party must be patient and wait at the top of stairs and take the Oni down as they come.
  
  Once it appears that no more Oni are charging in, pull and take out the nearest patrol of Outcasts, and then another patrol to the right of that first group. The path is now clear to a flight of stairs to the right. The whole party should run and hide here. From there, another patrol can be pulled and taken out. In general, every party member must anticipate the teleport and be ready to regroup with the rest of the party when it happens.
  
  Next, hug the right wall and engage another group of Outcasts that stands before the [[Kanaxai Aspect of Scorpions]]. Once that Aspect of Kanaxai is taken out, there should be about groups of Outcasts left, which the party can either ignore or easily take out.
  
  When fighting the Aspect of Kanaxai, healers must be very watchful as the effect will pull everyone to it. With powerful melee damage and [[Demonic Agility]], it can kill a party member (especially casters) very quickly while they are still recovering from the knockdown. Party-wide protection spells like [[Aegis]], [[Shelter]], and [[Displacement]] are very useful.
  
  ===Section 9 (damage while moving)===
  ; ''[[Aspect of Fear]]'' : ''While under this aspect, you move 10% faster. You take 25 damage each second you are moving.''
  
  Monks need to be watchful of party health and use skills like [[Heal Party]] often.
  
  Upon entering, it will appear empty. Do ''not'' enter the corridor and turn the corner before regrouping. Make sure the whole party is together, and as one, run into the corridor and turn the corner, and keep running. Large mobs of Oni of the Deep and nightmares will spawn ''behind'' the party and start to chase them. The best counter strategy is to keep running until the party reaches a sharp corner. Casters must bunch up into that corner and tanks need to body block and protect the casters. If the body block is set up correctly, [[trap]]s and [[AoE]] damage will take the enemies down easily.
  
  Once the pursuing mobs are killed, the party can go back to proceeding slowly. Along the way, there will be three long bridges spanning gaps. At the end of each bridge, there is a [[Thorn Flower]] and several groups of Oni popups. By this point, the party should already be reacting naturally, with tanks taking up body blocking positions and casters taking enemies down from behind.
  
  The [[Kanaxai Aspect of Fear]] stands at the end of the last bridge. It is up to the party whether to sweep and pull the Oni first or to pull the Aspect of Kanaxai first.
  
  ===Section 10 (energy depletion damage)===
  ; ''[[Aspect of Depletion]]'' : ''While under this aspect, whenever your Energy hits 0, you take 50 damage.''
  
  From this section onwards, the scenery will change. The party has progressed through the depths of the Jade Sea and has now entered the caverns deep beneath the sea itself. These dark and misty caves hold some of the most beautiful scenery in the game.
  
  There are a lot of [[Sapping Nightmare]]s in this section, and they specialize in draining energy. Be extra careful of their [[Chaos Storm]] and use skills like [[Blood Ritual]] or [[Blood is Power]] to counteract energy loss. Fortunately, they are quite easy to take out with proper tanking and caster damage from outside aggro.
  
  Killing the [[Kanaxai Aspect of Depletion]] is not necessary, as the party can just hug one side of this section and go past it.
  
  ===Section 11 (conditional health degeneration)===
  ; ''[[Aspect of Decay]]'' : ''While under this aspect, if you are [[Poison|Poisoned]] or [[Bleeding]], you suffer an additional -4 [[Health degeneration]].''
  
  This section is a circular cavern with a path circling up to a central mound. The [[Kanaxai Aspect of Decay]] stands atop that mound. The path around the mound is full of flowers that inflict bleeding and poison on party members. Careful sweeping is also required, as there are hidden groups of Oni scattered from the entrance until the exit. The flowers can be "deactivated" by clicking on them.
  
  The better strategy is to avoid the central area altogether and ignore the Aspect of Kanaxai (again, not required to kill it). The exit is to the left, as such, tanks should sweep and pull mobs from the left side of the cavern. When sweeping, pulling, and engaging mobs, make sure that battles do not occur within range of any flowers.
  
  ===Section 12 (damage unless skill used)===
  ; ''[[Aspect of Torment]]'' : ''While under this aspect, you take 50 [[damage]] every 3 seconds if you don't use a [[skill]].''
  
  This section has an environment effect similar to [[Wastrel's Worry]]. The long and winding path hide many hidden Oni and nightmare groups. The same strategy as before applies to tanking them. At the end of the path waits the [[Kanaxai Aspect of Torment]], accompanied by a group of Outcasts (though it can be pulled separately).
  
  ===Section 13 (heavy health degeneration)===
  ; ''[[Nightmare Aspect]]'' : ''While under this aspect, you suffer -8 Health degeneration.''
  
  This is the final section. [[Kanaxai]] can be found standing in here seemingly alone. The constant -8 health degeneration makes it imperative that some form of party-wide healing is available. Note that this environment effect does not go away even after Kanaxai is killed.
  
  Kanaxai is no pushover. He hits very hard and very fast. Each successful hit also knocks his target down. He also uses an [[enchantment]] called [[Nightmare Refuge]] (1-second cast time, 10-second recharge), which makes all spells and attacks that target him to fail 50% of the time. In addition, that enchantment ''also'' heals him for 1,000 [[health]] if it is not removed within 10 seconds (before it expires). And finally, like the Aspects of Kanaxai, he stops taking damage at 80%, 60%, 40$, and 20% of his maximum health. To resume normal damage, a knockdown is necessary (although [[life stealing]] skills continue to function). The difference between Kanaxai and his aspects are that each of Kanaxai's knockdown will spawn a mob of eight creatures:
  *[[Sapping Nightmare]]s (above 80% of maximum health)
  *[[Freezing Nightmare]]s (between 60% and 80% of maximum health)
  *[[Oni of the Deep]] (between 40% and 60% of maximum health)
  *Random mixture of the above (below 40% of maximum health)
  
  Skills like [[Spinal Shivers]] (or [[Shivers of Dread]]) can prevent Kanaxai from using his enchantment. Even better would be [[Revealed Enchantment]] or [[Inspired Enchantment]] to remove it. Since it is a [[monster skill]], the removal skill is immediately recharged.
  
  A conventional strategy is to body-block Kanaxai and [[trap]] all around him and around all [[monk]]s when he is knocked down. With sufficient traps, the spawned creatures will fall quickly.
  
  An alternate strategy exploits the fact that Kanaxai can have a maximum of 24 creatures (3 spawns) spawned at any one time. The idea is to trigger the spawns away from Kanaxai's default spot. The steps are as follows:
  #Pull Kanaxai to one side of the cavern. Note that it is very difficult to pull Kanaxai. A well-protected caster is a better Kanaxai puller than a tank. Let Kanaxai attack the caster and have the caster pull back slowly in staggered steps.
  #With Kanaxai near one side of the cavern, body-block Kanaxai and knock him down 3 times in succession, causing 24 creatures to spawn. The moment they spawn, the whole party must run back to the previous section. Do ''not'' kill any of the spawns.
  #When the party escapes back to the previous section, Kanaxai will return to his original spot in the cavern, and the spawns will home at the location where they spawned.
  #After recuperating, the entire party should head back in and head to the opposite side of the cavern (away from the spawns). Pull Kanaxai to that side, and body-block him to prevent him from running. Now the whole party should give everything they've got to take him down. Remember to have one party member tasked to constantly remove Kanaxai's enchantment.
  
  Variations from the above do exist, such as a tank to pull and run around maintaining aggro of all the spawned creatures while the rest party takes down Kanaxai. The [[assassin]] skill [[Recall]] allows that tank to quickly escape from the mob.

  Centuries ago, [[Turai Ossa]] saved the nation of [[Elona]] by defeating the undead lord [[Palawa Joko]]. In gratitude, the populace praised him as the warmarshal of [[Kourna]]... and the nation accepted him as their king. Since that time, all of Kourna\xE2\x80\x99s warmarshals have been directed descendents of Turai. [[Varesh Ossa]] is the latest inheritor of that legacy\xE2\x80\x94and like her ancestor, she has a vision for the future of the nation.\n\n\
  Varesh Ossa is a brilliant commander, a loyal Kournan who instills loyalty and dedication in her troops. Like her ancestor Turai, she has also shown an interest in more spiritual concerns. Elonians see much of Turai\xE2\x80\x99s greatness in Varesh. By using political acumen, her charismatic presence, and the influence of her family legacy, Varesh has rallied the Kournan army, inspiring them as Turai Ossa did long ago. Some loyal Elonians hope that she can unify the nation again, restoring it to the greatness of its past.\n\
  Others fervently hope that she does not share his madness. History will see how well Varesh succeeds on her own spiritual quest.\n\n\

  Take Toma into around the Marga Coast and attack enemies, but do not kill them, so that Toma can use Feeding Frenzy. Toma's hunger level decreases with each enemy eaten. When it is zero, return to Chuno to collect the reward.\n\n\

  :'''Melonni:''' ''\"Bad as Koss is, Chuno is worse! If anything, he's more arrogant than Koss, but without the ability to back it up.\"''\n\n\
  ===Reward dialogue===\n\
  '''Chuno:''' ''\"Ha! It's amazing how similar Koss and that beast are. They're both savage brutes. I shouldn't badmouth the beast by comparing him to Koss. Obviously, Melonni is fond of Toma.\"''\n\n\
  '''Chuno'''\n\
  :''\"By the gods! What an appetite this creature has. It looks content now, but I'm sure that creature could eat a herd of oxen if we let it. We'll see how good a guardian it makes.\"''\n\
  :''Ah, Melonni! If only you would join me for dinner! You know I never agreed with the elders who sent you away. I will wait until the end of time if need be!''\n\

  You've found a way through to Vabbi through the [[Bahdok Caverns]] now all that remains is to safely make it through to the other side. Easy... aside from the treachery and the small fact the Kournan's have got there before you.  Make sure you have [[Dunkoro]] in your party before entering the mission.
  
  ==Mission information==
  ===Requirements===
  Make sure that you have Dunkoro in your party before you enter the mission. 
  
  ===Objectives===
  Travel through the [[Bahdok Caverns]] to escape to [[Vabbi]]
  *'''Added''' Defeat Bayel and the Hunger to open the passage to Vabbi.
  *'''Bonus''' Follow Dunkoro's remaining suggestions.
  
  ===Reward===
  The reward for this mission depends on how many Dunkoro's four suggestions you follow.
  {{Mission reward
  | objective = Suggestions followed
  | standard = 0 - 2
  | expert = 3
  | master = 4 }}
  
  ==Walkthrough==
  
  At the start of the mission you are blocked in by some Corsairs, who claim to be your guides.  Eventually their leader, [[Captain Bohseda]], gets a quest marker and you can talk to him.  You have two options, either the trust him or to not trust him.  If you trust him, he will lead you up the corridor then he and the rest of the Corsairs will turn on the party and you will be ambushed by more Corsairs.  If you don't trust him, he and the rest of the Corsairs turn hostile straight away and you can fight them and the ambushing group of corsairs seperately.  Otherwise the choice has no impact on the rest of the mission or the bonus.
  
  If you choose to ignore Dunkoro the mission is pretty straight-forward.  From the area where you kill the ambushing corsairs there are two exits which head to the north.  Head up the one which will take you west, you'll meet a group of Corsairs coming down.
  Follow the river here until you get to an open area and follow the wall running perpendicular to the river, that is, turn right.  After following this you'll come to another exit to the right.  Walk into this area.  You should see two [[Corsair Runner]]s.  Head up to where they are and follow the runner which goes straight north - the one that doesn't run through the insects.  Additional Corsairs will arrive. Continue the way the Corsair was running after finishing this group and follow the path as it goes downwards.
  
  You will come to where the Kournan forces are.  [[General Bayel]] and [[The Hunger]] are on the other side of a narrow bridge which is well protected by [[Kournan Bowman]] with an excellent height advantage and are difficult for melee characters to get to.  Rather than trying to eliminate the rangers from the bridge, run right under the bridge and use it to shelter the team from the bow attacks.  You can now either use non-projectile attacks or spells to kill the Rangers or ignore them and make sure that that any melee attackers are protected while they attack in the open. Another option is to continue running past the Hunger and General to the other side out of range of the rangers. Kill both General Bayel and then the Hunger to end the mission.
  
  ===Bonus===
  
  The bonus is to follow the advice the Dunkoro offers at various points through the mission.  There are 4 suggestions, the notification of which sometimes comes quite late and the update of the success of the objective sometimes a long way after you followed the suggestion.
  
  # Head to the eastern exit from the area after the ambushing Corsairs.  Dunkoro will suggest you go to the western exit.
  # As you head up the western entrance, a corsair patrol will come towards you.  Part way up the slope, Dunkoro will suggest you hide your presence from this group by hiding near the waterfall.  It is best to not actually wait for this suggestion, because it can put you in an awkward situation.  Kill Mandragor groups at the bottom of the waterfall before approaching the path.  Walking on the path far enough to trigger the corsair group to move down the slope is sufficient to trigger the suggestion later then head straight to the waterfall.  After you receive the notification of completing the objective you can kill the corsair patrol.
  # Dukoro suggests you follow the eastern wall to keep away from the Corsair camps.  As this is the most efficent route through this shouldn't be a problem.
  # The last suggestion is the most difficult to complete.  Dunkoro suggests that you stop the Corsair Runners from warning the Corsairs that you are coming.  There are two Corsair Runners and true to their name, once you get close enough they run ... in different directions.  If possible split and take on both at once.  Use snares and speed boosts to make sure you can kill them before they reach their destination. Corsair Runners will use [[Antidote Signet]] to remove conditions which causes them to stop. This can be used to your advantage by inflicting conditions with a preparation such as [[Apply Poison]] or [[Barbed Arrows]].
  
  Once the last suggestion is completed continue on and finish the mission.
  
  ===Skill recommendations===
  *Several members of the team should bring [[Snare (tactic)|snares]] for the Corsair Runners. 
  *Skills which boost speed can be useful also, again to catch the runners.
  *[[Muddy Terrain]] is good to catch those runners.
  *An [[Elementalist]] [[Hero]] with [[Deep Freeze]] can be used to slow the runners so you can finish them off at leisure.

  '''Thirsty River''' is one of the missions required to achieve [[ascension]] in Prophecies.  
  As part of the trials to ascend, defeat six teams in an ever increasing difficult combat arena.
  ==Mission information==
  
  ===Objectives===
  Annihilate the opposing enemy teams.
  *Defeat [[Goss Aleessh]]'s team. 
  *Defeat [[Issah Sshay]]'s team. 
  *Defeat [[Hessper Sasso]]'s team. 
  *Defeat [[Josso Essher]]'s team. 
  *Defeat [[Lyssha Suss]]'s team.
  *Defeat [[Kesskah Shissh]]'s team.
  *''Bonus'' Cleanse the area before [[King Khimaar]]'s spirit is driven away. 
  
  ==Walkthrough==
  Before we fight the six teams mentioned in the objectives, there is the opportunity to gain morale bonuses by killing the [[Sand Giant]]s that preceed the first boss. There are five giants in all, each granting a 2% bonus. Three are in the first area, before continuing south down a path with burrowed scarabs, and two are after the path but before the gate. You are not timed yet, so feel free to pull scarabs at your leisure to clear the way to the giants.
  
  The rest of the mission is separated into rooms, each containing 1-3 groups. These groups have a boss, a priest, and a number of forgotten foes. Every two minutes after the door to a room is open, if the priest of the group is alive, it will resurrect all defeated foes in that group, thus timing is highly important in the larger rooms. Common practice it to focus fire on the priest at around the 1:30-1:40 mark (3:30, 5:30, etc for rooms with multiple priests) to ensure it is not alive at the 2:00 mark to resurrect everything you already defeated. If the timer reaches 1:55 and it appears your party will be unable to defeat the priest in time, exercise the better part of valor and pull back to prevent being instantly swarmed by the respawned foes. The door to the next room is opened when all foes in the current room are bested.
  
  You'll see a [[Ghostly Hero]] in front of a gate to the first room. This room has only one group, the mesmer, [[Goss Aleessh]] and a couple of [[Forgotten Illusionist]] and [[Forgotten Champion]] subgroups. [[Chaos Storm]] is annoying, so target the Illusionists first before proceeding to the warriors. Remember to focus on the priest before it has a chance to resurrect its allies. Once all the foes are defeated, proceed through the door the Ghostly Hero opens and follow the path to the next room.
  
  This room has two groups, headed by the elementalist [[Issah Sshay]] and the necromancer [[Hessper Sasso]]. Each group has its own priest, so it is not required to kill both before 2:00 has passed. You will most likely aim to finish off one group in the first two minutes and the other in the following two minutes. Issah and [[Forgotten Arcanist]]s await straight ahead through the gate, while Hessper and [[Forgotten Cursebearer]]s await to the right. Whichever group you choose to engage first, try not to aggro anyone from the other group. If it takes a significant amount of time to kill one group, consider waiting until about 3:50 before attacking the second group (try not to kill anyone until after the 4:00 mark has passed). However, foes do gain [[death penalty]] if you want to defeat a patrol or two beforehand, making them easier to kill the second time around.
  
  The third room has three groups. The warrior boss, [[Custodian Hulgar]] lies to the right, the monk [[Josso Essher]] to the left, and the ranger, [[Custodian Phebus]] in between. Ii the final area the right group will, while killing [[King Khimaar]], leave a gap large enough to get through to their priest and kill it, if you don't care about the bonus it's reccomended to get there quickly and eliminate the priest and then defend there when the group returns. As before, time your attacks such that the priest can be eliminated before every two minutes passes. Of all six groups, Josso's is by far the most difficult. He has [[Word of Healing]], often making it frustratingly difficult to kill his priest in time. If your team has high enough damage output, it's possibly to simply outdamage the healing. Otherwise, someone should try to interrupt or disable Josso's healing skills while the rest of the party focuses on the priest. Without his priestly support, Josso is much easier to defeat. Once all three groups in this room are defeated, the mission ends.
  
  ===Bonus===
  In the final room, you'll hear the ghost of [[King Khimaar]] calling for help. The bonus is achieved upon completion of the mission if the king is still around. He will leave if the party takes more then ten minutes to clear the final room and he can be killed by foes. Either condition will fail the bonus, so make sure healers keep the king alive if he falls under attack. Usually, [[Custodian Hulgar]]'s team will start attacking the king when you enter the final room. The king will die by the end of the first minute without help - so it's a good idea to head for [[Custodian Hulgar]]'s team first to remove the pressure on the king.
  
  ===Skill recommendations===
  *If the party has an overall low damage output, bring skills specifically to interrupt or disable the monk boss's healing. It can be frustrating to get all the way to the final boss just to be unable to kill him and his priest.
  *Every type of boss in the Crystal Desert can be found in this mission. Bring a [[Signet of Capture]] if you have not yet captured the elite for your profession here. Remember the mission ends as soon as the final group is defeated, so if you wish to capture the elite from one of the final bosses, do not leave that group for last.

  *Unlike many Mesmer interrupts, Cry of Frustration can interrupt ''any'' action, including basic attacks.
  *This is an exellent opening move since everyone will be casting thier first spell or skill at about the same time.

  *When interrupted by this your character will cry out of frustration screaming "#$%#!!".

  Elite and non-elite '''skill tomes''' can be acquired as loot while in [[hard mode]] from any defeated creatures of the profession of the tome and as random drops from a [[Locked Chest]]. Each profession has an elite and non-elite skill tome that allows the [[character]] who reads it to learn a [[skill]] for that [[profession]] that they have already unlocked elsewhere for the [[account]].  Skill tomes can stack with others of the same type and profession.  It does not cost a [[skill point]] to learn a skill using a skill tome.\n\n\
  Skill tomes can only be used while in a [[town]] or [[outpost]], not while in an instanced area. \n\n\
  ==Skill tome==\n\
  A non-elite skill tome can be used to learn any one non-elite skill associated with that tome's correlated profession if that skill is [[unlock]]ed on your account. These are named after their profession, so a tome for a [[monk]] skill is named a \"Monk Tome\".\n\n\

  ==Elite skill tome==\n\
  An elite skill tome can be used to learn any one [[elite skill]] associated with that tome's correlated profession if that skill is unlocked on your account. Where standard skill tomes can be dropped as loot from any hard mode foe of the appropriate profession, up to two elite skill tomes can drop from [[Locked Chest|locked chests]] or as loot from hard mode [[boss]] creatures of the appropriate profession. Learning an elite skill through a skill tome adds a point to the [[Skill Hunter]] title for the character that reads it. These are named after their profession, so an elite tome for a [[dervish]] skill is named an \"Elite Dervish Tome\".\n\n\

  | preceded by = [[Gate of Madness (mission)|Gate of Madness]]

  }}
  This mission has a simple objective; to kill [[Abaddon]] before he breaks completely free from his bindings.  Compared to the previous mission [[Gate of Madness (Mission)| Gate of Madness]] this mission seems much easier.
  
  Approach Abaddon and he breaks free.  Kill the [[Graven Monolith]]s at his hands first, to the left and right, and then those at the middle, at his head, to rebind him.  Once done you can attack his head until he breaks free again.  At this point swiftly return to the hands and repeat the cycle until Abaddon is destroyed.   Watch for his area effect knockdown and dazing attack, [[Words of Madness]], and random [[Torment Claw|Torment Claws]].
  
  ==Mission information==
  ===Objectives===
  Destroy Abaddon.
  * Destroy the Graven Monoliths to power the chains of Abaddon.
  
  ===Reward===
  The reward for the mission depends on how long you take to kill Abaddon.
  {{Mission reward
  | objective = Time taken (minutes)
  | standard = > 25
  | expert  = < 25
  | master = < 20 }}
  
  ==Walkthrough==
  For this mission you are accompanied by Kormir, she does not take damage so you will not need to concern yourself with her presence.
  
  Run along the passage until you get to the end, there is only one way you can go.  You'll come to a bridge which looks down on the spot where Abaddon is imprisoned.  There are three paths down to Abaddon from here, two to the binding points for each of his hands which are situated to the left and right and one which leads to where his head is bound in the middle.   Two Graven Monoliths guard each of the binding points, a maximum of six are on the map at any one time.  
  
  Abaddon will break free as you approach and you must kill the Monoliths to rebind him and get the opportunity to attack him.  It is best to attack the Monoliths at the hands first, as killing those at the head first, without first rebinding the hands means the Monoliths will respawn at the head, wasting your effort.  
  
  When the Monoliths at each of the binding points are destroyed Abaddon's head will be lowered and you will have a short while to lay down as much damage on him as possible before he breaks free and you have to start over again at rebinding the hands to get another opportunity to attack.  It will take several cycles of binding, damaging and breaking-free before Abaddon is killed.  Get into a rhythm, agree before-hand which side you will go to first each time so your team can kill off the Monoliths with least effort.  Each time you rebind part of Abaddon by defeating a pair of Monoliths you will receive a [[morale boost]].
  
  Abaddon isn't entirely defenseless while you complete this ritual, he has a number of attacks which can be rather frustrating and damaging for a team.  Of particular note is Words of Madness which causes the team to be knocked down, dazed and to take damage;  key to coping with this is timing your skill use to avoid getting interrupted.  Of particular note is when Abaddon is in his prone state, invariably this skill is used about 5 seconds after he is bound just when you're launching into your best spell.  The team has to be prepared to remove daze or to operate with it on. Party wide healing is a good counter to the area of effect damage which Abaddon deals.
  
  Finally, Torment Claws appear from time to time during the battle.  They have a nasty area of effect attack which can devastate your team if they're not noticed and taken care of.  Keep a wary eye out for them and use your Lightbringer's Gaze to interrupt their attack skill and kill them.
  
  ===Skill recommendations===
  *Bring [[Lightbringer's Gaze]] for the Torment Claws. Alternatively, any skill interrupt will do.
  *The healers should concentrate on party wide condition removal and heals, for example:
  **[[Light of Deliverance]], [[Heal Party]], [[Recuperation]]
  **[[Martyr]], [[Extinguish]], [[Cautery Signet]], [[Recovery]]
  *Bring plenty of direct damage and armor ignoring damage.  
  *Consider spells with short activation times to avoid getting interrupted.
  * A Paragon with [["Fall Back!"]] helps a lot when Abaddon breaks free and your party needs to move away from him before being attacked by the recently spawned monoliths.
  *Ritualists with [[Vengeful Weapon]] can just stand aside with their party and cast it
  
  ===Master's Bonus The Easy Way===
  Anyone can "run" this mission in 10 to 12 minutes using the Ritualist skill [[Weapon of Remedy]] which you can capture while riding worms in [[The Sulfurous Wastes]].  [[Reversal of Damage]] should work in exactly the same way.  [[Vengeful Weapon]] would also work a bit more slowly, but not everyone has access to Factions.  Whatever your primary profession is, set your secondary to ritualist, go capture [[Weapon of Remedy]], and then head back to [[Abaddon's Gate]].  You will need 1x Healer Hero, 2x Nuker Hero, Mhenlo and one other human.  Make sure that you have [[Weapon of Remedy]] on your skill bar and also on the skill bar of each hero.  Everyone should have a Restoration Magic of 12 for this.
  
  * Step 1: Enter the mission and kill the [[Graven Monolith]]s on the right side.  This is easy to do with just your heroes and Mhenlo.  If you have trouble with this, ask the other humans in the party to stay on the bridge so the healers have fewer people to deal with.
  * Step 2: Circle back up past the bridge and go kill the [[Graven Monolith]]s on the left side.  Keep an eye out for [[Torment Claw]]s during these first two steps and deal with them IMMEDIATELY if they pop up.  If you don't have an interrupt to stop the [[Torment Slash]], you probably won't survive.
  * Step 3: Retreat to the middle of the bridge and plant your flag to hold Mhenlo and the heroes.
  * Step 4: All other human members of the team run straight down to [[Abaddon]] and die.  This serves two purposes.  First, it keeps them from needing to be healed by [[Mhenlo]].  Second, it draws [[Kormir]] down to [[Abaddon]] and keeps her out of the way. (see notes below)
  * Step 5: While everyone is dying, shift-click on each of the healing skills on your healer hero's skill bar to disable them.  [[Mhenlo]] can handle the healing from this point on so there's no reason to let the hero blow himself out of energy trying to help heal.  If your healer hero has [[Heal Party]], you can trigger it manually every once in a while to make yourself feel like you're helping [[Mhenlo]] but he really doesn't need the help.
  * Step 6: Every 8 seconds, Abaddon will fire off [[Word of Madness]] which knocks you down.  After your character stands back up, cast [[Weapon of Remedy]] on yourself and then force each hero to cast it.  As long as you're not targetting anything, everybody will cast on themself.  The next time [[Abaddon]] casts [[Word of Madness]], he loses 63 health to each person who has [[Weapon of Remedy]] up.
  
  Repeat Step 6 for about 10 minutes and [[Abaddon]] is dead.
  
  Notes:
  * If you don't get [[Kormir]] out of the way, all of the heroes will cast their [[Weapon of Remedy]] on her.  [[Weapon of Remedy]] will be wasted since she doesn't take any damage from [[Word of Madness]].
  * Sometimes you'll get [[Torment Claw]]s spawning constantly in the middle of the bridge.  If this happens, bail out and start over.  It's not normal and there's no chance you'll get Master's Bonus while that is happening.
  * If any of the other humans in the party have [[Weapon of Remedy]], you can finish the mission faster by having them remain on the bridge with you and cast it on themself every 8 seconds.  Remember though that [[Mhenlo]] can only handle the healing for 5 people.  If you leave more than 5 alive, [[Mhenlo]] will need a bit of help.
  * It may not be necessary to kill the second set of [[Graven Monolith]]s.  You just need to get [[Abaddon]] to the point where he's casting [[Word of Madness]] every 8 seconds.  Killing both sets of [[Graven Monolith]]s will definitely do that.

  ==Notes==

  ==Trivia==
  Enter the mission, just before the point Abaddon breaks free type the /dance emote (Every non NPC in your party must dance for this to work).  Not only do you start dancing, but Abaddon joins in, with a dance of his own! This includes a "Shimmy" like the warrior dance followed by a "raise the roof" and finally he will Mosh out. However, after this point your team will die and the message "You Got Served!" will appear on the screen.  BEWARE if your entire party dances even when Abaddon is half dead he will start dancing. This is most probably a reference to the film "You got Served".

  ==Walkthrough==\n\
  This quest is best begun from Seeker's Passage.\n\n\
  Tip This quest can be done nicely together with [[Ancient Secrets]], which is given by [[Fangfa Tai]] in The [[Amnoon Oasis]]. The dual quest may be also started from Seeker's Passage.\n\n\
  Starting from Seeker's Passage, go southeast until you go through a narrow channel, then round the wall to your left and up another narrow channel with wooden plank steps and platforms. You will reach Chebar, the objective of this quest, at the top of the channel beside the teleporter.\n\n\
  If you are also doing [[Ancient Secrets]], continue by teleporting, then move in a northeasterly direction until you find Sennat Sen, the objective for Ancient Secrets.\n\n\
  You need to take it slowly. You will encounter [[Rockshot Devourer]]s, [[Jade Scarab]]s and a pretty large number of [[Storm Kin]]. The Storm Kin patrol in small groups but can move very quickly along their patrol routes, so it is easy to aggro more than you would like. They also seem to aggro from farther than your aggro circle, so be careful to deal with these in as small numbers at a time as possible, and heal up and recharge between encounters.\n\n\
  Note: It is possible to simply run to Chebar, even without a running skill, going headlong through the groups of enemies. Hire a full party of henchmen and let them serve as distractions. Assuming you don't trigger any traps, the most dangerous thing you'll face is constant Health degeneration from [[Conjure Phantasm]] and [[Parasitic Bond]], but this is unlikely to be fatal as the run is not a very long distance. If you choose to bring a self-healing skill, be aware that the Rockshot Devourers use [[Distracting Shot]].\n\n\

  :''\"Forgive me if I seem startled, but it has been ages since a living being has spoken to me... Please, don't think less of me, but I have a rather selfish request of you. When the...event...that destroyed my people occurred, I was supposed to meet my betrothed Chebar out in the Salt Flats near one of those curious teleportation pads. We thought it was a perfect place to be alone. It has been my single lasting torment that I never found out what happened to Chebar. Although it is unlikely that any sign of his...remains...would have survived to this day, I would like to be certain.''\n\n\
  :''Would you go to the Salt Flats and see if you can find any sign of Chebar?\"''\n\

  ===Intermediate dialogue===\n\
  '''Chebar'''\n\
  :''\"Tirzah's ghost has sent you? Oh my beloved...so that's why she never came that day. I have waited here all this time hoping against hope that one day I might know her fate, but to find out that she is a ghost bound to this hellish place as I am...it is almost beyond bearing. I know of something that might bring her a small bit of joy. Take this '''silver ring''' and give it to her. On the day we were supposed to meet, I was going to ask for her hand in marriage. Perhaps the ring will give her some small comfort.\"''\n\n\

The [[Lich Lord]] brought him back from the dead to serve him, and he meets with his old allies near the end of [[Hell's Precipice (mission)|Hell's Precipice]], where he is bound to the lich's will and is commanded to kill the players. You can allso see him in the cinematic for [[Thunderhead Keep (mission)|Thunderhead Keep]] at the end.

  This is the quest which allows a PvE character to unlock the [[Ritualist]] [[hero]] [[Razah]] in the Nightfall campaign.\n\n\
  ==Quest information==\n\
  ===Requirements===\n\
  A PvE character which has completed the Nightfall campaign\n\n\
  ===Objectives===\n\
  ====Old objectives====\n\
  * Ask [[Keeper Millzesh]] about gaining entrance to the [[Heart of Abaddon]].\n\
  * Explore and investigate the [[Heart Of Abaddon]].\n\
  * Free [[Razah]] by destroying the [[Binding Guardian]]s.\n\
  * Speak to [[Razah]].\n\
  * See [[Chaplain Phyratyss]] for your reward.\n\n\
  OR\n\n\
  *QUEST FAILED: [[Keeper Mirzesh]] is missing! Return to [[Chaplain Phyratyss]] in the [[Gate of Anguish]] for more information. (sic)\n\n\
  ====Current objectives====\n\
  * Speak to Keeper Shafoss to gain entrance to the Heart of Abaddon.\n\
  * Explore the Heart of Abaddon.\n\
  * Destroy the binding guardians and free Razah. 3 of 3 guardians remain.\n\
  * Speak to Razah.\n\
  * See Chaplain Phyratyss for your reward.\n\n\
  ===Reward===\n\
  * 2,500 [[Experience]]\n\
  * [[Razah]] joins your party.\n\n\
  ==Walkthrough==\n\n\
  After you enter the Heart of Abaddon, dispose of the patrols around the first [[Binding Guardian]]. Wait at the entrance for the first one to move towards you, but be careful - there are four different patrol groups in the area, and drawing even only two of them may be enough for your party to be defeated. \n\n\
  If you have any skills that kill friendly spirits (e.g. [[Gaze of Fury]]), dispose of the guardians as you move along to save time later. After the second and third guardian, talk to Razah and you are finished.\n\n\
  If you did not kill the guardians earlier, they turn red after you talk to Razah. You now have to go back and kill them. Careful: There is a pop-up group with each of them. The pop-up groups near the two guardians closer to Razah can be avoided by only attacking with at long range (bow, wands, spells). The pop-ups linked to each of those consist in a group of [[Margonite]]s and a group of the [[Shadow Army]]. The pop-up group for the first guardian consists of 4 [[Titan Abomination]]s, which will charge at you - remember that it's best to kill one at a time, otherwise you may end with 8 [[Madness Titan]]s against you. After killing the guardians, talk to [[Razah]] again to finish the quest.\n\n\
  For the first guardian (the one you meet at the start of the map) there is a very easy way to kill him without having to kill the titans. presuming you've already cleared out the enemy on your way to Razah, let the titans spawn. then [aggro] them and lure them back away. After a while they will stop following you. They will retreat to their spawning place. While doing this, have one Ranger with a Longbow or Flatbow (might be possible with other bows but not tested) go near the entrance gate. this gate is on a hill and you will have a very easy time to destroy the guardian. the titans are part of a separate group so do not come after you. The guardian has regeneration so make sure your damage rate is high enough. After you have killed him, run back trough the titans. This is easy with a blocking skill like whirling defense, which is already on most ranger skillbars. The titans will follow you for a while but then retreat. you might get knocked down once or twice, but probably will have enough HP to survive, if you're not sure then let a monk come towards you to heal.\n\n\
  The other 2 guardians can be killed by ranging them with longbow or flatbow. this is certain for the one on the far side of Razah, confirmation on the closest guardian is needed.\n\n\
  These last two tricks can be done with a single ranger, presuming he has enough damage output to counter the regeneration. A maximum damage bow (15-28) that is modified combined with spamming [[Barrage]] will do, although it will take a while. If you have a ranger hero, make sure he has either a Longbow or a Flatbow, or he will activate the spawns.\n\n\

  '''Elona Reach''' is one of the missions required to achieve [[ascension]] in Prophecies.  
  
  ==Mission information==
  
  ===Objectives===
  Help the [[Ghostly Hero]] complete the ritual that will combine the three pieces of the [[Vision Crystal]].
  *Return [[Crystal Shard]] 1 to the Ghostly Hero.
  *Return Crystal Shard 2 to the Ghostly Hero.
  *Return Crystal Shard 3 to the Ghostly Hero.
  *'''Bonus''' Use the Crystal Shards to awaken the three Ritual Priests of Elona
  
  ==Walkthrough==
  This mission is split into two parts. The first part is to simply find the Ghostly Hero and bring him the first Crystal Shard that the party begins with. He can be found northwest of the party's starting location. Beware, as a fairly large group of [[Minotaur]]s patrol the valley. Even if you are on the bridge, the minotaurs below will aggro and come around. Is is common for the party to simply engage the patrol just before reaching the [[Dune Burrower]] blocking the bridge. 
  
  Watch for [[Splinter Mine]]s, as they are throughout the mission. When any party member moves in the area of one, a ward-like circle appears. After a few seconds, anyone within the area will become [[crippled]] and begin [[bleeding]]. The mine will continue this unless its core is removed. If a player touches the core, it will be picked up as a bundle and the mine will no longer activate (although it will finish its current cycle, often resulting in the player who picked up the bundle to suffer the conditions unless he or she moves fast). Furthermore, the core may be dropped, seconds after it will cause all foes in the area of it to become crippled and bleeding. It may not be used again after it is dropped.
  
  When the player carrying the Crystal Shard talks to the Ghostly Hero, the second part of the mission begins after a cut scene. The party has 30 minutes to find the last two Crystal Shards and bring them to the Ghostly Hero (who will remain close to the gate). Many groups faulter by attempting to rush under the time constraints, but there is sufficient time to move slowly, pull groups, and otherwise be patient and still have plenty of time to spare, even if attempting the bonus as well. So do not rush though this and it will be much easier. The only time consuming possibility is if your engage multiple [[Forgotten Sage]]s or worse, the monk boss [[Whissper Inssani]] along with a sage. If your party has a difficult time defeating these, run away, break aggro, and let the monks separate again before rejoining the fight.
  
  There are two gates out of the fort, one to the south, and one to the west. Likewise, one shard lies to the south and the other to the west. Outside the fort is a courtyard with various forgotten patrols. Two patrols tend to pass by the western gate, so if that gate is used, be wary of the patrols and try not to aggro more then the party can handle. For this reason, the southern gate is often used. When engaging forgotten patrols, focus on the Forgotten Sages first. They have [[Word of Healing]], which is a great heal for others but cannot be used on themselves.
  
  When approaching the southern crystal, you may choose to go around the bridge, avoiding the boss awaiting you on the other side. There are two patrols on the other side, one which approaches the side gate and another that frequents the cliff overlooking the gate. Pull the gate patrol first, and do your best to defeat the sage before the second patrol has a chance to aggro. Fighting two sages healing each other is often time consuming, and with close proximity to the boss's group it can be very risky. Once these patrols are defeated, the party may choose to fight the boss's group or hug the southern cliffs to avoid it. At the top of the hill, you should see the Crystal Shard guarded by a boss and company. Either defeat the group to clear the crystal or use a Splinter Mine to cripple the group, allowing a single player to grab the crystal and run away with it. Backtrack the path you cleared to return this crystal to the Ghostly Hero.
  
  You can fight through the western gate if you wish. But to save repeating work, you can cross the courtyard and find a path behind a boulder to the south to quickly make your way towards the western crystal. Pull the boss and its group away from the courtyard and defeat it behind the boulder. Rush northwest towards the wall, keeping away from the patrols that cover the courtyard. Defeat the group there and work your way westward. You should see the last crystal, again with a boss. Once again, you can either defeat this group or simply plant a splinter mine to cripple them, grab the crystal, and run. Beware of the [[Enchanted Sword]]s however, as they can use [[Hamstring]] to cripple the runner. Once you have the third crystal, its easiest to backtrack again, going across whatever path you've already cleared to return to the Ghostly Hero and complete the mission.
  
  ===Bonus===
  To achieve the bonus, the players carrying Crystal Shards must approach three gravesites, prompting various ghosts to appear and walk towards the Ghostly Hero. Any crystal will activate any gravesite, and crystals may be used multiple times if needed. Note that the ghosts will engage and fight any foes they encounter, but the do not follow the party and do not need to survive to be rewarded the bonus.
  
  The first gravesite is located east of the party's starting location in the mission behind two Dune Burrowers. This site should be trivial to reach, but if you forget to trigger it, bringing one of the other two crystal shards to trigger it may be time consuming. The priest triggered by the first gravesite will start walking up towards the ghostly hero. He will get attacked and killed by mobs if the party is not careful. Unless you are sure that you can kill the mobs fast enough, or don't care about the priest surviving as the priests death won't stop you from obtaining the bonus, clear all the way to the ghostly hero first (but do not hand him the crystal), then backtrack and get the priest.
  
  The second gravesite is located behind the boulder between the second and third crystal locations. It is common to use this path anyways to travel between the second and third crystal sites, so just remember to hit it with one of the two shards. It has a small group of forgotten guarding it, but they should be easy to deal with.
  
  The third gravesite is located north of the western crystal, thus to the northwest of the courtyard. It is most common to use the western crystal to trigger this site, but you can also have carried the southern crystal across to do it. It too has a group of forgotten protecting it. Try not to aggro one of the nearby groups when you engage it.

The Great Northern Wall: "{{Location disambiguation|The Great Northern Wall}}\n\
  {{Mission infobox\n\
  | name = The Great Northern Wall\n\
  | campaign = Prophecies\n\

  | type = Cooperative\n\
  | partysize = 4\n\
  | duration = Short\n\
  | preceded by = [[Defend the Wall]]\n\

  }}\n\
  It's been too quiet lately. Go past the wall and find Bonfaaz and his army. Try to find out what they're up to.\n\n\
  ==Mission information==\n\n\
  ===Objectives===\n\
  Scout for [[Bonfaaz Burntfur]]'s [[Charr]] forces.\n\
  *Search the Wall to find the Charr army.\n\
  *Report your findings to [[Captain Calhaan]].\n\
  *'''Bonus''' Recover the four pieces of [[Kilnn Testibrie]]'s armor and return them to his tomb\n\n\
  ==Walkthrough==\n\
  Speak to the Captain. He will brief you on the situation and tell you to scout the wall to find the charr army. Head outside the gate to the north. Eventually you will find a [[devourer]] or [[grawl]] [[boss]] near a gate with a [[lever]]. Pull the lever to open the gate. follow the path heading West for a short distance, until you reach a split with several devourers. Continue North where you will find a large group of gargoyles attacking some grawl. Wait until the fight is over to attack ''or'' simply run past them as they don't tend to follow. Pass the bridge and take the first path to your left, heading West. At the end of that path you'll see a campfire with some Charr and a boss. After you killed them run through until the cutscene starts.\n\n\
  After the cutscene, run south to the wall. It is highly recommend that you don't stop for anything along the way as it could result in the Charr catching up to you. Talk to Captain Calhaan and your mission will be completed.\n\n\
  '''Note''':  In Hard Mode, the Charr will be running significantly faster, which may present some problems.  Bringing a running skill can solve this, but a simpler way is to skip the cutscene; this will buy you a head start.\n\n\
  ===Bonus===\n\
  You can do the some parts of the bonus before you actually talk to Kilnn. Follow the walkthrough until you reach the split after the gate. There's a pile of wreckage hidden behind a wall-leftover (1). Use the wreckage to obtain the first item. Then, go to the Northeast, following the right road of the split. It's slightly hidden, so keep your eyes open. You can find another wreckage here, close to where the grawl and gargoyles are fighting (2). Cross the tar pit heading North, going under the bridge (don't mind the gargoyles on it). Follow this road, and you will find Kilnn Testibrie's ghost near his tomb. He will give you the bonus objective. After you talk to him, follow the road to another boss and a wreckage (3). Keep running down the path and you should find the last wreckage (4), near the end of the mission where the Charr are. Now take the four items back to Kilnn.\n\n\

  ==Notes==\n\
  *This mission has a large \"hidden\" part of the [[Cartographer]] title. You can slip past the appoaching Charr and explore the map from there on. Additionally, the path you take while running back has some corners and sideways.  Complete exploration of this area contributes approximately 1.2% to the Tyrian [[Cartographer]] title.\n\

  {{Mission infobox
  | name = Dasha Vestibule
  | campaign = Nightfall
  | region = Vabbi
  | type = Cooperative
  | requiredhero = Margrid the Sly
  | duration = Medium
  | preceded by = [[Greed and Regret]]
  | followed by = [[Pledge of the Merchant Princes]]
  }}
  The merchant princes have walled themselves up in the depths of the Vestibule. Upon entering, the defenses are activated, unleashing a number of [[elementals]] and traps to block the way. In order to reach the princes, the party must travel with [[Goren]] and complete three trials to unlock the door to the inner sanctum.
  
  ==Mission information==
  
  ===Requirements===
  [[Margrid the Sly]] must be in your party before you enter this mission.
  
  ===Objectives===
  * Complete the trial in each chamber to open the way into the inner sanctum.
  * [[Goren]] must survive
  * '''Added''' Defeat the Eternal Guardians to complete the Trial of Eternity.
  * '''Added''' Answer the riddles posed by the Divine Djinn to pass the Trial of Divinity.
  * '''Added''' Solve the crystal puzzle to complete the Trial of Wisdom.
  * '''Bonus''' Help Margrid collect the Treasure of Ahdashim.
  
  ===Rewards===
  {{Mission reward
  | objective = Treasures found
  | standard = 0
  | expert = 1 - 2
  | master = 3 }}
  
  ==Walkthrough==
  The entrance to the three chambers has a number of groups of Djinn. Tackle them one group at a time. When fighting groups of Djinn, the Ruby Djinns using Searing Flames should be a priority target as they can deal massive amounts of damage to the party. Proceed towards the far wall where you will find three paths. The central path leads to the Trial of Eternity(1 on the map), the left the Trial of Divinity(2), and the right leads to the Trial of Wisdom(3). The only path open at this time is the Trial of Eternity.
  
  ===Trial of Eternity===
  There are six Eternal Guardians which produce global environmental effects for this trial. Defeating a guardian will remove its effect. Complete the trial by defeating all six guardians.
  
  Guardians may produce one of three environmental effects. The guardians at the base of the stairs produce lesser effects then those further back. These effects are as follow:
  {| {{STDT}}
  |-
  | '''Name'''
  | '''Lesser Effect'''
  | '''Greater Effect'''
  |-
  | [[Eternal Suffering]] 
  | -1 [[health degeneration]]
  | -2 health degeneration
  |-
  | [[Eternal Lethargy]]
  | Move 10% slower
  | Move 20% slower
  |-
  | [[Eternal Languor]]
  | Skills recharge 10% slower
  | Skills recharge 20% slower
  |}
  
  Note that when you reach the stairs, the left path is slightly more difficult, as the guardians of the sapphire chest will spawn once the party gets close to the chest and augment the group of Djinn and guardians already there. Either pull the Djinns away from the chest or take the path to the right. This requires defeating the [[Ruby of Ahdashim]] which is needed for the bonus.
  
  Upon completing the trial, the door to the Trial of Divinity will open.
  
  ===Trial of Divinity===
  Beware of the two traps placed just after the left turn in the entrance corridor to this trial. It is best to pull the Djinn away from the traps to battle them to avoid accidentally being caught in them.
  
  Towards the back of the room stands a row of [[Divine Guardians]]. They will ask questions regarding the [[Gods of Tyria]], and you must choose the answer that fits the clue the best. The clues change during each run of the mission, but the answers are always the same. From left to right, the answers are as follows:
  #Balthazar 
  #Dwayna 
  #Grenth 
  #Lyssa 
  #Melandru 
  #Abaddon 
  
  Upon completing the trial, the door to the Trial of Wisdom will open.
  
  ===Trial of Wisdom===
  Like the Trial of Eternity, the first turn is greeted with Djinn and a pair of traps. Again, pull the Djinn away from the traps to battle before preceeding.
  
  In the main chamber stand four [[Thunder of Ahdashim]] which are much like [[Diamond Djinn]] except hold a special skill [[Quake of Ahdashim]]. This skill will knock down and damage players in the area, also destroying any crystal keys they may be carrying. It is thus best to try to dispatch them before attempting the puzzle.
  
  The puzzle itself involves two crystal keys and four obelisks with the first four prime numbers, 2, 3, 5, and 7. Closer to the entrace lie six pedestals containing the numbers 6, 10, 14, 15, 21, and 35. Setting a key on a pedestal will activate those obelisks which are factors of that number. So for example, placing the key on 6 will activate its prime factors, 2 and 3. The goal is to activate all four obelisks. Luckily, the arrangement is such that placing a key on any two pedestals equidistant from the ends will accomplish this. So the combinations are 6-35, 10-21, or 14-15. Failing to match up the obelisks properly will spawn a new set of Thunder of Ahdashim as well as reset the keys.
  
  Upon completing this trial, the doors to the Central Chamber will open. Note, if you wish to attempt to complete the bonus, do so now before proceeding.
  
  ===Central Chamber===
  The final stage of the mission(at 4) contains three Djinn bosses. Of these, the most dangerous is most likely the elementalist, Kormab. Luckily, every boss may be pulled and fought separately from the others. Keep in mind the mission will end upon defeating all three bosses, so should a player wish to capture a skill from one of them, that boss should not be the last one defeated.
  
  Beware that Goren must stay alive, so make sure he does not rush ahead into the group of bosses while you are pulling.
  
  ===Bonus===
  Each of the three trials contains a chest and a Djinn of Ahdashim. The Djinn will drop a key corresponding to their name, and chests must likewise be opened with the key matching their name. Be aware that each chest is guarded by a group of Djinn that appear when the chest is approached. The chests and keys are laid out as follows:
  {| {{STDT}}
  |-
  | '''Trial'''
  | '''Chest'''
  | '''Key'''
  |-
  | Eternity
  | Sapphire
  | Ruby
  |-
  | Divinity
  | Diamond
  | Diamond
  |-
  | Wisdom
  | Ruby
  | Sapphire
  |}
  
  Should you leave the mission for any reason without using a key, that key may still be used on a later attempt to open the corresponding chest.
  
  ===Skill recommendations===
  *Most of the foes you will be facing are [[djinn]] and thus are unaffected by [[Bleeding]] and [[Poison]]. Thus, these conditions should be left out. Likewise, they do not leave corpses, so Necromancer skills that target corpses should also be left out.
  *[[Ruby Djinn]]s can deal substantial area fire damage. Consider bringing [[Ward against Elements]] and/or [[Ward against Harm]] to substantially reduce the damage. Other methods to mitigate damage from [[Searing Flames]] include the Paragon elite, [[Cautery Signet]], the Monk skill [[Extinguish]], or the Mesmer skill [[Signet of Humility]].
  *[[Sapphire Djinn]]s hit multiple times when attacking, so skills such as [[Spiteful Spirit]] and [[Empathy]] deal substantial damage to them.

  '''Goren:''' ''"The princes are protected in the central chamber of the city. They are locked inside and I can't get to them."''<br>
  '''Margrid the Sly:''' ''"The sealing incantations of Ahdashim only allow those of royal blood to enter freely. All others must face the sacred trials. Luckily, you brought someone along with the ncessary knowledge, skill, and valor to gain entry... namely, me."''<br>
  '''Diamond Djinn:''' ''"INTRUDERS! Ahdashim will be your crypt!"''<br>
  '''Margrid the Sly:''' ''"The vault's guardian spirits don't look happy to see us. This won't be easy."''
  
  
  '''Margrid the Sly:''' ''"Ah, the Eternal Guardians. I thought these were just a mythe to scare off wannabe treasure hunters."''<br>
  '''Goren:''' ''"This is bad. The city thinks we are enemies."''<br>
  '''Margrid the Sly:''' ''"Get ready! We'll have to take out these guardians to get through."''<br>
  '''Margrid the Sly:''' ''"Now that we've finished off those pushovers, there's only two more trials to face before the door to the Central Chamber opens."''<br>
  '''Goren:''' ''"How you know so much about this place, lady Margrid?"''<br>
  '''Margrid the Sly:''' ''"Just Margrid, please! I've done some... okay... a lot of research on this place. Every corsair dreams of plundering the Hidden City of Ahdashim!"''<br>
  '''Goren:''' ''"Okay, Just Margrid."''<br>
  '''Margrid the Sly:''' ''"Sigh. I give up. Let's keep moving. The doors to the other chambers shouyld be open now."''
  
  
  '''Magrid the Sly:''' ''"If I remember correctly, this is the Chamber of Divinity. Our knowledge of the gods will be tested here."''<br>
  '''Goren:''' ''"I don't like tests."''<br>
  '''Margrid the Sly:''' ''"Neither do I, but we'll just do our best. Okay, big guy? Those djinn over there look like they're waiting for us. Let's find out what we need to do next."''<br>
  
  
  '''Margrid the Sly:''' ''"Now that wasn't too bad, wasn't it?"''<br>
  '''Goren:''' ''"My head hurts."''<br>
  '''Margrid the Sly:''' ''"Toughen up, big man. It's nothing a little absinthe won't take care of."''<br>
  '''Margrid the Sly:''' ''"On to the last trial we go. Let's get this over with."''<br>
  
  
  '''Goren:''' ''"What are all these numbered thingies?"<br>
  '''Margrid the Sly:''' ''"This must be the Trial of Wisdom. Not many have made it this far, so I don't know much. The numbers are supposed to be the key."''<br>
  '''Goren:''' ''"Not math! I hate math. It makes my brain hurt more than god tests."''<br>
  
  
  '''Goren:''' ''"The door to the princes open now?"''<br>
  '''Margrid the Sly:''' ''"Should be. Let's hurry. The treasure... I mean, the princes... are waiting."''<br>
  '''Goren:''' ''"I have a bad feeling about this..."''
  
  ==Notes==
  *For most of the mission, Goren should sustain little damage. The most dangerous times are if you try to run away, as Goren will usually be last to follow and thus be the focus of enemy fire. This is especially true in the Central Chamber fight where the bosses may deal lethal damage to Goren should you need to flee. Traps also have a possibility to deal substantial damage to Goren if not careful.

  }}
  
  == Notes ==
  *The [[Signet of Capture]] is a [[signet]] used to learn a [[skill]] from a [[boss]]. Signets of Capture are primarily used to capture [[elite skill]]s but they can be used to capture any skill the boss is using that is not already known by the player character and is not a [[monster skill]]. Only skills for [[Profession|professions]] that match the character's [[Profession#Primary_Profession|primary profession]] or [[Profession#Secondary_Profession|secondary profession]] may be captured.
  *Whenever a character learns a new elite skill using the Signet of Capture the character progresses through the [[Skill Hunter]] [[title]] track.
  *Although a player may equip only one elite on their skill bar, using multiple Signet of Captures can allow the character to have multiple elites on their bar albeit temporarily until they zone into another area.
  *Signet of Capture cannot be used to capture elite skills from some low-level bosses in [[Istan]].
  *Signet of Capture cannot be used in PvP.
  *Signet of Capture cannot be used by [[heroes]].
  * The Signet of Capture is actually a ring, not a skill. This is proven by the creator of the Signet of Capture, [[Magi Malaquire]] who says "''...Of course, there was a small chance that you might combust when the '''ring''' absorbed the...''"
  
  ==Acquisition==
  A Signet of Capture may be acquired from several sources.
  *As a reward for the [[quest]] [[Malaquire's Test]] (Prophecies Characters only)
  *As a reward for the [[quest]] [[Minister's Test]] (Factions Characters only)
  *As a reward for the [[quest]] [[Capturing the Signet of Capture]] (Nightfall Characters only)
  *Purchased from any [[skill trainer]] from [[Lion's Arch]] onward. (Prophecies)
  *Purchased from any [[skill trainer]] on the mainland in Factions.
  *Purchased from any [[skill trainer]] on the mainland in Nightfall.
  *A player's [[Guild Hall]] may contain a skill trainer which will allow purchase of a signet even if the player has not progressed far enough through the game to obtain it from one of the other trainers.
  
  == Capturing Skills ==
  The following steps allow a player to capture a skill using the Signet of Capture.
  
  *Obtain the Signet of Capture
  *Add the Signet of Capture to the players skill bar
  *Find an appropriate boss (see the [[List_of_elite_skills_by_capture_location|elite location list]])
  *Kill the boss
  *In the vicinity of the boss, click the Signet of Capture.
  *A panel showing the skills available for any dead bosses in the area will then be shown.  Clicking the available skill and ''capture'' will cause the Signet of Capture to be replaced with the new skill.

  | followed by = [[Pledge of the Merchant Princes]]
  }}
  [[Prince Ahmtur the Mighty]] has chosen to take a stand against the invading [[Kournan]] and [[Margonite]] forces at the stronghold of Dzagonur Bastion.  You are to support his forces and prevent the stronghold from falling to the invading forces.
  
  This mission represents a split in the storyline determined by your choice of either [[Master of Whispers]] or [[Margrid the Sly]] earlier in the story.  You must have Master of Whispers in your party to enter this mission, if you do not have him, you can return here after completing [[Abaddon's Gate (Mission)|Abaddon's Gate]] or enter with someone who has Master of Whispers.
  
  ==Mission information==
  
  ===Requirements===
  You must have Master of Whispers in your party to enter the mission.
  
  ===Objectives===
  Defeat the Margonite Generals before their forces take the citadel.  Preserve the perimeter bombards to aid you in the battle.  Defend the gates to prevent enemy forces from reaching the Citadel.
  * Speak to Prince Ahmtur the Mighty.
  * n of 3 gates still stand.
  * n of 3 bombards still function.
  * n of 4 generals still remain.
  *'''Bonus''' Keep the bastion's defenses intact.
  * n of 6 defenses left intact.
  
  ===Reward===
  The reward for this mission is determined by the number of defenses left standing at the end of the mission.
  {{Mission reward
  | objective = remaining defenses
  | standard = 0
  | expert =  1 - 4 
  | master =  5 - 6 }}
  
  ==Walkthrough==
  The aim of this mission is to make sure that the citadel is not captured.   You aren't alone in this task, you have several groups of Vabbi soldiers to help you out and siege support from the citadel.  You start out in the citadel and use a teleporter to exit the stronghold and begin the mission.
  
  In front of the citadel there are 3 groups of Vabbi soldiers.  The [[Disciple of Secrets]] which leads the group can be given instructions on where they should be defending.  It is recommended that you send 2-3 groups to defend one side, possibly leaving one to defend the middle.
  
  Initially a few groups of Kournan soldiers will come towards the citadel.   Focus your defense on the side without the Vabbi defenders, but you may need to travel widely to help control the Kournans.  In a team with 2 or more human players, split into two teams of 4 for mobility and better defense.  If you are alone it can be sufficient to flag a hero which is able to look after themselves to help the side with the Vabbi defenders - Master of Whispers as a minion master is a good choice.  2 groups of Vabbi defenders will have trouble defending a side without some assistance.
  
  After several waves of Kournan groups four Margonite bosses, the Generals, will spawn at the far edge of the area in front of the citadel.  The Chaos rifts which they control will continue to spawn groups of Kournan soldiers accompanied by a single Margonite demon as long as the boss is alive.  The bosses must be killed to reduce the defensive workload for the team and complete the mission.  The Generals will only come down towards the fort when each defense is broken - so the elementalist boss will come down to the East Bombard when the East Bombard is destroyed by the Kournan forces and will move onto the gate and beyond when the Kournan forces have destroyed the East Gate.  The generals in order from west to east are; {{w}}General Doriah, {{mo}}General Nimtak, {{p}}General Kumtash, {{e}}General Tirraj.
  
  Go to the side which does not have the Vabbi defenders.  Kill any group of Kournans which emerge after the boss spawn and then push up to take out the boss.  Fall back if need be to defend the middle, but each time you attack try to kill one of the Margonites in the bosses group.  When that boss is killed get on top of the defensive situation on the other side and middle then work on the next boss along from the one you just killed.  When the second boss is killed the worst is over and it should now be easy for you get the situation under control as the attackers and defenders are focused in the same spot.   Take out the remaining two bosses to finish the mission.
  
  ===Bonus===
  For the Master level on this mission only 5 of the 6 defensive structures need to remain.  
  The instructions can be successful to achieve Master level.
  
  If attempting the bonus alone, it may take a few attempts to be successful. To improve the odds of winning, assign a minion master at each of the 3 bombards, and concentrate more groups of Whispers on the bombards that will need protection for a longer duration. When attacking the bosses, take the minion master protecting the corresponding bombard with you, and upon successfully defeating the boss, re-assign him to help with remaining bombards. If you need extra minion masters, you can use elementalist heroes (with some cold AoE attacks).
  
  ===Skill recommendations===
  * Set Master of Whispers up as a [[Minion_master|Minion Master]].

  ==Mission information==\n\n\
  ===Objectives===\n\
  Seek the truth about the [[White Mantle]].\n\
  * Locate [[Blade Scout Ryder]]. He'll take you to the [[Bloodstone]].\n\
  * Use the vine bridges to traverse the jungle.\n\
  * '''Added''' Travel on to the Bloodstone on your own.\n\
  * '''Bonus''' Awaken the [[Druid]]s while preserving their guardians.\n\n\
  ==Walkthrough==\n\
  Players start the mission looking for Blade Scout Ryder and his party. Saidra informs the party that he has gone ahead and drops a Vine Seed. Use this to create a bridge. Along the way there are more Vine Seed Plants (A-D on the map) which, when clicked, yield a Vine Seed that will need to be used to create bridges at spots marked by a glowing circle on the jungle floor. Players should note that each Vine Seed Plant produces one Vine Seed and  [[Moss Scarab]]s pop up when a seed is taken. The number of Vine Seed Plants at a location is a good indication of about how many Vine Seeds the party will need to pick up.\n\n\
  Mobs encountered include [[Wind Rider]]s, [[Jungle Troll]]s and [[Moss Scarab]]s in medium-sized groups so be prepared for hexes, conditions and melee damage.\n\n\
  Eventually the party will find itself at the [[Bloodstone]], and must engage [[Justiciar Hablion]] upon the stone itself. This is made challenging by the fact that [[Resurrection#Resurrection skills|Resurrection skills]] take longer to cast on allies who perish on the Bloodstone's surface. Try to avoid dying on the stone if at all possible by pulling small groups off to the side and fighting there.\n\n\
  This mission is not all that difficult if you keep one or two things in mind while completing the main objectives and the bonus. The beginning of the mission follows the formatted run and kill all foes in your path. After completing or skipping the bonus, once you reach the Bloodstone, try this: Instead of charging into the fray, scurry to one side of the stone. Take out the White Mantle Abbot and the fellow with him! Then, run over to the other side of the stone (without going past Justiciar Hablion) and defeat that White Mantle Abbot and his companion. It will make taking out Justiciar Hablion '''much''' easier!\n\n\
  ===Bonus===\n\
  The bonus for this mission is to use [[Vine Seeds]] to awaken four [[Druid]]s so that they, in turn, may awaken the [[Elder Druid]]. All of this must be done without harming any of the Jungle Guardians who protect the sleeping Druids. If a single Jungle Guardian is slain, a group of [[Ravager]]s will be summoned that the party must contend with instead of the Druid, and the Bonus can not be accomplished.\n\n\
  The bonus is obtained upon awakening the first Druid (1 on the map) by dropping a Vine Seed on the glowing circle. Instead of creating a vine bridge, this awakens a Druid. The Druid speaks, then walks slowly across a nearby Vine Bridge and stops where the Elder Druid is to be summoned (point 4 on the map). Players will find other Vine Seed Plants near this spot that they can use to awaken the other three (marked 2 on the map).\n\n\
  With henchmen in the party, this bonus can be annoying as you are not allowed to kill ''any'' of the [[Jungle Guardian]]s and henchmen will attack anything that attacks them. Avoid attacking the Jungle Guardians at ''all'' to prevent the henchmen from engaging. If you are not using [[henchmen]] and are lucky enough to have a full party of people, then one option is to section off into two teams. One team awakens the druids, while the second team follows behind them and distracts the guardians.\n\n\
  Alternatively, if the player has [[Hero|Heroes]] from the [[Nightfall]] campaign the normal henchmen can be flagged before the first Jungle Guardians and the heroes can be set to Avoid Combat. This ensures that the Jungle Guardians will not be accidentally harmed, though it effectively limits the party size to four. Likewise, you can set your pet to \"heel,\" in which case they will avoid combat.\n\n\
  Occasionally the first Druid can get stuck on the first pair of Jungle Guardians.  You can attempt to free it by pulling the Guardians a short distance.\n\n\

  [[Melonni]] is a [[dervish]] [[hero]] available in [[Guild Wars Nightfall]]. Originally a native of Kourna, Melonni's dedication to her home village has made her ''persona non grata'' in her own homeland. She has a flinty determination and is not above open acts of rebellion to achieve her goals. She is a member of the [[Order of the Sunspears]].\n\n\
  From the Guild Wars [http://www.guildwars.com/theworld/heroes/ official website]:\n\
  :''Headstrong Crusader''\n\
  ::''\"You can push, but I will push back... only harder, much harder.\"''\n\n\
  :'''Origin:''' [[Kournan]]<br>\n\
  :'''Age:''' 26<br>\n\
  :'''Profession:''' [[Dervish]]\n\n\
  :''Melonni's a headstrong young woman from a small town in Kourna, an idealist who's become a thorn in [[Varesh Ossa]]'s side. The villagers of her homeland will never forget her, and with good reason. Melonni antagonized Varesh so much that the entire region is now under the watchful eye of Kourna's militarized government. As for Melonni, she has no regrets, because she always does what she knows is right. She sees herself as a woman who fights for what she believes in... even when no one else around her agrees.''\n\n\
  :''When she left in search of adventure \xE2\x80\x94 or more precisely, left to protect her home from Kournan reprisals \xE2\x80\x94 many citizens were hoping that she'd never return. Deep in her heart, she knows that her decisions will be proven right in the end. For some unfathomable reason, she seems to be very concerned whether Koss understands the importance of her values. Melonni is slowly learning to pick her fights a bit more carefully, largely through trial and error, and she's courageous enough to finish the fights she starts. By the time she's ready to return to her home, she's hopeful that she'll be welcomed as a hero. If no one can accept that, she'll just have to show them the error of their ways.''\n\n\
  From the Guild Wars Nightfall manual:\n\
  :''Melonni's an idealistic crusader from a small town in Kourna. She sees herself as a woman who fights for what she believes in... even when no one else around her agrees. When she was younger, no cause was too daunting, no sacrifice too great for the sake of her people. For better or for worse, the villagers of her homeland will never forget her. Now that she's older, she's learning to pick her fights a bit more carefully, largely through trial and error. Deep in her heart, she knows that her decisions will be proven right in the end. By the time she's ready to return home, she's hopeful that she'll be welcomed as a hero.''\n\n\

  ==Armor==\n\
  Melonni starts with basic armor labeled as [[Sunspear armor#Hero armor|Sunspear armor]] and a Reaper's Hood. The armor has a unique appearance that bears a resemblance to both Sunspear armor and Elonian armor. Her armor provides +1 [[Scythe Mastery]] and +25 [[Health]], and has an [[armor rating]] of 10 to 70, depending on her level.\n\n\
  The appearance of her armor can be upgraded to [[Sunspear armor#Hero armor|Elite Sunspear armor]] using [[Stolen Sunspear Armor]] acquired from the [[Dajkah Inlet]] [[challenge mission]]. The appearance of her armor can be upgraded to [[Primeval armor#Hero armor|Primeval armor]] using [[Primeval Armor Remnants]] acquired in the [[Domain of Anguish]] and during [[the Ebony Citadel of Mallyx]] mission.\n\n\
  ==Notes==\n\
  *A duplicate Melonni will show up as a \"Sunspear Dervish\".\n\
  *If you elect to put [[Faithful Intervention]] in her skill bar, because you want the enchantment to increase the strength of Mystic Sweep and/or you have given her a \"while enchanted\" weapon, and or you have upgraded her armor with insgina that actives \"while enchanted\" and you want Faithful Intervention always on - you will need to activate it manually. Her AI does not activate it upon entry into an explorable area and does not seem to give it priority in activations during play. (Interestingly, the various \"attunement\" skills activate for the [[elementalist]] heroes)\n\n\

  ==Dialogue==\n\
  ===Initial dialogue===\n\
  '''Ivor Trueshot'''\n\
  :''\"There are many aspects to being a Ranger, but none more important than skill with a bow. I can help you become a great archer, but first you must show me that you have potential. If you follow the ridge eastward, you'll find a colony of plague worms anxious to rise up from the ground and attack the unsuspecting traveler. If you can kill all the '''plague worms''' in the allotted time, I'll believe you have the makings of a real Ranger. I'll give you a couple skills, temporarily, that a true marksman would use to meet this challenge.\"''\n\n\
  :'''Accept:''' ''\"I like a good challenge.\"''\n\
  :'''Decline:''' ''\"I don't have time for your games.\"''\n\
  :'''When asked about quest:''' ''\"Hurry to the east and kill those '''plague worms'''. I won't give you more time just because you're standing around here.\"''\n\n\
  ===Reward dialogue===\n\
  '''Ivor Trueshot'''\n\
  :''\"I can see that you will be a great archer some day. Keep these skills, and as long as you follow the path of marksmanship, they will serve you well.\"''\n\n\
  ==Notes==\n\
  *The worms do not need to be killed with a bow to complete this quest."

  ==General==
  [[Celestial Horror]]s are giant, durable [[minion]]s that resemble [[Flesh Golem (minion)|Flesh Golem]]s and are summoned by [[necromancer]]s using the [[Kuunavang#Celestial_Skills|celestial skill]] [[Star Servant]]. They use [[melee]] attacks and their attacks cause all party members to gain 25 [[Health]] and 3 [[Energy]] every time they hit. 
  
  Celestial Horrors count as minions bound to their master. They are subject to the minion cap imposed by the rank in [[Death Magic]] and will become masterless if their summoner dies. They also suffer from usual minion decomposition rate (see the [[minion]] article for more details).

  ''"Ahai, fellow traveler. What brings you to these parts? Let me guess... you're out hunting rockhide scavengers and hooded ledgewalkers for their sinewy hides, right? Ah, the smell of the outdoors, the sound of creatures being mercilessly slaughtered for their pelts, and the zen-like repetition of that single moment when you hold your breath waiting to see if said creatures will drop a usable hide or not. I love it! It's a shame I have neither the time nor strength to hunt at the moment. I'm busy stitching the hides I have into a grand carpet for my living room. The trouble is I'm a few hides short of a full rug. If you're willing to flex those rippling muscles of yours and bring me 5 [[Behemoth Hide]]s, I'll give you:" ''

  Win at the [[Luxon]] convocation to claim the [[Spear of Archemorus]].
  
  ==Mission information==
  
  ===Objectives===
  Triumph in the Convocation and earn the right to use the Spear of Archemorus against Shiro.
  * Defeat the three Champions and their Seaguard.
  * Retrieve the Spear of Archemorus.
  * Defeat Zhu Hanuku using the Spear of Archemorus.
  
  ===Reward===
  {{Mission reward
  | objective = Time taken (minutes)
  | standard = > 25
  | expert = < 25
  | master = < 20 }}
  
  ==Walkthrough==
  To earn the right to challenge Zhu Hanuku, the party first has to defeat the champions from three luxon clans. Each group includes two bosses, the next group will spawn and move towards the center of the arena as soon as the last mob of the previous group is killed. While the first two groups should be fairly easy, the third one includes [[Argo]] a very hard hitting elementalist boss. Keeping him interrupted will be very helpful for the party.
  
  After defeating the champions, the party gains access to the [[Spear of Archemorus]]. While it is not needed to finish the mission, it somewhat speeds up fights to bring it along. Make your way directly towards [[Zhu Hanuku]]. The patrols on the way can mostly be avoided, only kill those that might aggro while you fight Zhu Hanuku.
  
  Zhu Hanuku can pose a dangerous enemy. It's [[Jade Fury]] skill will deal large amounts of AoE damage in a wide rage. Additionally, Zhu Hanuku resurrects the Kraken Spawns that also spawn once the fight starts. However, both the resurrect and the Jade Fury skill have long activation times. A ranger or mesmer with interrupts can completely shut Zhu Hanuku down, making the fight very easy. In absense of these, the melee fighters should bring interrupts to do the job.
  
  ===Master's reward===
  Since the "normal" way to fight the mission is very quick, all groups should be able to achieve master's reward, unless there is a wipe.
  
  ===Skill recommendations===
  * Plenty of [[interrupt]] skills for Argo and Zhu Hanuku.
  * As a Ranger (or bow-wielding Ranger secondary) you might consider bringing Broad Head Arrow (or a signet of capture, since it is one of the elites capturable during this mission), this will ensure that both Argo and Zhu Hanuku are kept interrupted constantly.

  == Notes ==
  *This Spell is often used by Monks in [[PvP]] using a technique called '''pre-veiling'''. By activating this skill before they are engaging in combat, any enemies attempting to cast a [[Hex|hex spell]] on the ''pre-veiled'' target (usually the Monk himself) will have the casting time of that hex doubled. This is especially useful against Mesmers, with the frequently used hex [[Diversion]] since it has a casting time of three seconds, which means that it takes a full six seconds to apply [[Diversion]] on a ''pre-veiled'' target and it can then be removed easily by simply ending the [[enchantment]].
  *Heroes are able to effectively use this skill to remove hexes, since they immediately stop maintaining most maintained enchantments.

  | region = Vabbi

  [[Varesh]] is attempting to turn the once holy site of the [[Sebelkeh Basilica]] into a portal for Abaddon's minions. Enter the Basilica and close the torment rifts before [[Abaddon]]'s [[Blasphemy]] corrupt the Alter of Lyssa.
  ==Mission information==
  
  ===Requirements===
  Make sure that you have [[Tahlkora]] in your party before entering this mission.
  
  ===Objectives===
  The Altar of Lyssa must not be captured by the Blasphemy.
  *Capture the torment rifts guarded by the Margonites.  Stand near a rift to claim it. 
  
  ===Reward===
  The reward for this mission is based on how quickly you complete the mission.
  {{Mission reward
  | objective = Time taken (minutes)
  | standard = > 9
  | expert =  < 9 
  | master =  < 6 
  | hardstd = > 16
  | hardexp = < 16
  | hardmstr = < 12}}
  
  ==Walkthrough==
  
  The Sebelkeh Basilica is laid out in circular fashion, with the [[Altar of Lyssa]] at the center and three platforms branching off to the south, northwest, and northeast.  On each of these platforms is a group of 7 [[Margonite]]s, a [[Torment Claw]], and a [[Torment Rift]].  You must capture all three of these Torment Rifts, without losing the Altar of Lyssa, to complete the mission.
  
  ===Securing the Altar===
  When the mission begins, you will be in a teleportation circle at the end of a narrow passage directly north of the Altar of Lyssa.  As soon as any party member leaves this circle (including heroes/henchmen), the mission timer will start and the the first wave of Margonites will trigger.  (Parties should thus make sure that all human players have loaded before moving.)  A total of six Margonites, two from each of the three Rifts, will rush the Altar and begin capturing it.  The party must position themselves near enough to the Altar to cancel this capturing effect - 8 party members can easily override 6 Margonites - and then kill off the Margonites.

  |}
  
  When you have killed both of the Margonites that came from a certain Rift, a second pair from that Rift will trigger and move towards the Altar.  A good strategy would be to kill only ''one'' Margonite from each pair in the first wave, then kill off the remaining three one at a time, waiting after each one to take out the second-wave pair that will come rushing in.
  
  ===The Blasphemy===
  After you have survived both waves of Margonites, [[The Blasphemy]] will begin to spawn.  It will appear at a random rift and move to the Altar; once there, it will use [[Summon Torment]] to "jump-start" capturing it.  While The Blasphemy is capturing the Altar, you will be unable to cancel its effect on the Altar's capture bar - it will be in a permanent "+1" state until you kill The Blasphemy.
  
  The Blasphemy has very low armor/hit points and is easy to kill, but when it dies, it casts the [[Last Rites of Torment]] hex on all party members and 3 [[Unbound Energy|Unbound Energies]] will spawn from its corpse.  The Unbound Energies are also easy to kill, but because of their quick attack rate combined with Last Rites of Torment, they will wreak havoc on the party while they live.
  
  The Blasphemy will respawn after a short delay when you kill it; this delay decreases with each Torment Rift you capture.  Be careful not to kill The Blasphemy while there are still Unbound Energies around from the last time you killed it.
  
  Sometimes, The Blasphemy will not go to the Altar, but instead to a Rift you have already captured and attempt to re-open it.  This can complicate the mission somewhat and make it more difficult to achieve the Master's Reward, especially if it does this while you are capturing the final Rift, as all three Rifts must be 100% captured to complete the mission.  However, it can also be advantageous - simply set one hero to [[Hero#Combat modes|Passive mode]] and plant his/her flag next to that Rift.  This will cancel The Blasphemy's effect on the Rift's capture bar, and you won't have to kill The Blasphemy until after you have captured both other Rifts.
  
  ===Capturing the Rifts===
  Ignore The Blasphemy when it first spawns and move to capture one of the Rifts.  It will be guarded by three Margonites and a [[Torment Claw]], all of which you must kill; otherwise, they will re-open the Rift after you have left.  It is very beneficial to have the entire party move near the rift (but away from the Claw) so you can begin capturing it while you are killing the enemies.
  
  The Torment Claws use the [[Torment Slash]] skill, which can be very devastating if the party is bunched in front the Claw; however, since the Claws are stationary, casters and ranged attackers can simply avoid the Claws entirely.  The skill is also very easy to interrupt, due to its long activation time.
  
  After you have captured the Rift and killed all of its defenders, go back to the Altar and kill The Blasphemy and the Unbound Energies that spawn.  After you have completely re-captured the Altar, go capture the second Rift.  Kill The Blasphemy at the Altar again, then go to capture the last Rift.  With only one Rift remaining, The Blasphemy will respawn almost immediately, but you should again ignore it and focus on capturing the Rift.  The mission will complete shortly after you capture the last Rift, no matter how many Margonites are left or how close The Blasphemy is to capturing the Altar.
  
  ===Skill recommendations===
  *[[Lightbringer's Gaze]] is very useful in this mission, as all enemies are vulnerable to it.
  *[[Last Rites of Torment]] can be removed from the entire party quickly using [[Inspired Hex]] (or [[Revealed Hex]])
  *Bringing various [[interrupt|interrupts]] are useful for making your battles with the [[Torment Claw|Torment Claws]] easier. A good idea if you are hero/henching the mission, if you have [[Acolyte Jin]] or [[Margrid the Sly]], is to have them lock their target on the claw. When the claw begins to rise up (meaning it is casting [[Torment Slash]]), have your hero use their interrupt skill.

  As a member of the White Mantle you've been asked to take the [[Eye of Janthir]] to [[Loamhurst]].
  
  ==Mission information==
  ===Objectives===
  * Administer the Test of the [[Chosen]].
  * Retrieve the [[Eye of Janthir]] from [[Justiciar Hablion]] in the upper courtyard of [[Shaemoor]].
  * Deliver the Eye to the coastal city of [[Loamhurst]].
  * '''Added''' Cleanse yourself in the [[Fountain of Truth]] on the hill to the southeast.
  * '''Bonus''' Find and escort all the chosen to Loamhurst.
  
  ==Walkthough==
  To get to Shaemoor, simply follow the winding path. Along the way, you will encounter various groups of Krytan wildlife, though they should pose no threat to you. When you reach the village, speak to Hablion. Following the cutscene, you will find a gate to your southeast opening. Head through there and cleanse yourself in the fountain atop the hill (do this by simply standing in it). Return to Hablion to acquire the eye. The eye will now follow your party, alternating between members. When it nears an NPC, if the NPC is knocked down, ignore them. If they remain standing, they are Chosen and will now follow you.
  
  Along the way, you will have to fight through enemies such as [[Inferno Imp|Inferno Imps]] and [[Gypsie Ettin|Gypsie Ettins]]. The eye, if close enough to enemies, will occasionally emit a shockwave, knocking them down.
  
  After a while, you will find a village with [[merchant|merchants]] in it. It is not mandatory to save them (none of them are chosen), though saving them will give you a morale boost.
  
  Later on, you will enter a swamp. Fight through the undead to reach Loamhurst. After that, speak to the Lionguard there, and your party will be paid a certain amount of money depending on how many Chosen are rescued. Be sure to do this before taking the eye to the pedestal as instructed, else you will miss out on being paid (you must also speak to this Lionguard to turn in the bonus objective).
  
  ===Bonus===
  To complete the bonus, you must find all the Chosen and get them to Loamhurst unharmed. Many of them will be under attack, so it is advisable for the monk in your party to keep them alive long enough to fend off the attackers. There are five villagers, between collecting the Eye of Janthir, and getting to Loamhurst, that must be collected along the way:
  
  # In the village where you collect the Eye
  # After the stone bridge; he'll cry "Help me!" as you get close, and is under attack by [[Tengu]]. Once they're defeated, he'll tell you that his caravan was attacked, and they scattered to the hills. At this point, you'll have the bonus added to your objectives.
  # Follow the path south-east from there, and you'll find the third villager under attack by more [[Tengu]].
  # Head back on to the road to Loamhurst. There's a fork in the road; take the left (south-west) turn, and you should encounter gypsie ettins. With the second group of ettins is the fourth villager.
  # The next one is tricky; you'll find a group of merchants under attack, and a villager. The villager is the one you want to save, but if you can save the merchants too, you get a morale boost.
  
  For some, it has been found easier to rescue the fifth villager before rescuing the fourth. In this case, players may often find that, when going back for the fourth villager, she will NOT be under attack by the Ettins, which is good as, of all the creatures attacking the villagers, a group of Ettins can wipe out a Chosen quite quickly.

  *Because the spell has a long [[duration]], it is a good spell to use to provide the "if you are under the effects of a weapon spell" condition that some other skills require for maximum effect(i.e. [[Wielder's Boon]] or [[Wielder's Strike]]).
  *Damage is only dealt to foes adjacent to the target, not to the target itself.
  *When used with attacks that hit multiple targets, '''Splinter Weapon''' triggers once for each target. E.g [[Barrage]].

  [[Vizier Khilbron]] is the last known survivor of [[Orr]] following [[The Cataclysm]], and the ex-advisor to [[King Reza]] of Orr. He is responsible for the Cataclysm after reading a dark incantation from the forbidden scrolls, defeating the Charr army at the gates of [[Arah]], but, in turn, destroying the entire kingdom.
  
  [[Evennia]] of the [[Shining Blade]] makes a deal with him that, in return for the [[Scepter of Orr]] (which they had acquired earlier in [[Riverside Province]]), he will lend his aid to the conflict between them and the [[White Mantle]]. He makes various appearances throughout the storyline, aiding players by giving them advice, casting [[Enchantment|enchantments]] on the party, and various other things. In the [[Ring of Fire]] island chain, he tricks players into opening the [[Door of Komalie]], setting free the [[Titans]] which he then controls using the scepter, and reveals his identity - the [[Lich Lord]].

  In the monastery, if your character is an Elementalist:\n\
  :''\"Greetings! I am Headmaster Vhang, the most recently promoted and far and away the youngest of the headmasters here at the monastery. To reach this lofty position, I mastered the skills of an Elementalist in just a few short years, scored perfectly on every Elementalist test, and single-handedly smote the infamous [[Bog Beast of Bokku]]. You are fortunate, indeed, for you will be training directly with me.\"''\n\n\
  In the monastery, if your character is not an Elementalist:\n\
  :''\"Because you are not an Elementalist, it is inconceivable that you might ever achieve the power I hold in even the smallest of my fingers. However, you can at least tell everyone you know that you have met me. Congratulations!\"''\n\n\
  Kaineng City (town and outposts)\n\
  :''\"Not many people are lucky enough to go on an adventure with me. I'm sure you'll treasure this journey for the rest of your life. If you're lucky, maybe I'll save a few of our enemies for you to destroy so you can join in the glory.\"''\n\n\

Fortunately, they are hosting an event they call the Convocation, and most Luxons have returned to their capital, Cavalon, to partake in the festivities. I would be surprised if Rhea was not there to oversee the competition. \"''\n\n\

  :'''Master Togo:''' ''\"For my part, I have not been able to obtain the Spear of Archemorus, however, I have contacted an old friend of mine, Rhea. Perhaps you remember her?\"''\n\
  :'''Brother Mhenlo:''' ''\"Elder Rhea? That is good news. If any of the Luxons can help us, she certainly can. Perhaps one of us should head back to Cantha to tell the emperor of our success, and the other continue on to Rhea?\"''\n\
  :'''Brother Mhenlo:''' ''\"Of course, Master. May Dwayna bless your mission.\"''\n\n\
  '''Seaguard Lykaios'''\n\
  :''\"Not many outsiders make it past these gates and into Boreas Seabed, but I see that Master Togo is with you. I wouldn't dream of denying him passage! Let me know when your party is ready.\"''\n\n\
  ===Reward dialogue===\n\
  '''Elder Rhea'''\n\
  :''\"Don't tell Togo, but it saddens me that Mhenlo was not with you all. It would have been nice to see that dear boy. He's so charming, that one... Well, anyhow, good luck against the clan champions. Remember this: they all have their own strengths and weaknesses. Learn what these are, and the Spear of Archemorus is yours.\"''\n\n\

  The shortest route is to map to [[Augury Rock]] and then go north-west from there to enter the ditch. Follow the Ditch till you find the [[Ancient Remains]], once you click on the yellow text you will recieve the sword. Then just map back for your reward.\n\n\
  ==Dialogue==\n\
  <!-- Transcription of dialogue. -->\n\n\
  ===Initial dialogue===\n\n\
  :''\"Ho there! [[Yort the Bronze]] has need of a favor. If you do this favor for Yort the Bronze, he will offer you a boon! Yort has misplaced his [[Ceremonial Family Sword]] near an oasis in Prophet's Path. Don't ask how this came to pass, there were many Centaurs and Yort's ghastly demise involved, and he doesn't feel like going into details!\n\n\
  :''Will you help Yort recover his ceremonial family sword?\"\n\n\
  :''Accept:\n\n\
  :''\"<Name> will do it!\"\n\n\
  :''Decline:\n\n\
  :''\"Yort will have to find someone else.\"\n\n\
  :''When asked about quest:\n\n\
  :''\"Help Yort the Bronze find his ceremonial family sword in Prophet's Path.\"\n\n\
  ===Reward dialogue===\n\
  :''\"Yort the Bronze is truly pleased that you've found his ceremonial family sword. Yort's spirit will now rest a little easier knowing that his dishonor has been erased. Yort the Bronze is truly humbled by your valor, <name>.\"\n\n\
  ==Notes==\n\
  The Ceremonial Family Sword uses the same skin as a Fiery Dragon sword.<br>\n\
  All though [[The Amnoon Oasis]] looks to be the closest. If you leave from there, you will have to walk all the way around to be able to enter the ditch.\n\n\

  ==Walkthrough==\n\
  Enter [[Zehlon Reach]] by way of the Astralarium.  As you approach the group of three children, they'll begin to discuss the spores they stole from Scholar Chago.  They'll notice you and start running--Nehduvad in one direction, and Adina and Paldinam in the opposite direction.\n\n\
  It's best to use a speed boosting skill here to try and catch the children before they wander off.  If the children slip away from you, don't worry.  They meet up near the exit to the [[Cliffs of Dohjok]] to the south.  The children will run through mobs of insects, corsairs, skale, and plants.  Travel southwest and take out the groups one by one, grabbing bounties along the way.\n\n\
  If you reach the exit to the Cliffs of Dohjok before the children do, simply wait for them to show up.  Use your speed boosting skill of choice to run up to them and get the spore.  Once you've spoken with all three children, return to the Astralarium and see Scholar Chago to get your reward.\n\n\

Please, go to [[Zehlon Reach]] and get the spores back from the children before one of them gets hurt!\"''\n\

The emperor wishes you to speak with '''Danika zu Heltzer''', Count zu Heltzer's daughter. She may be more prone to helping us gain the Urn of Saint Viktor than her elders. Seek her out near the '''Sunjiang District'''. Mhenlo will accompany you into Kurzick territory.

  :''\"This poor child! I had to kill her parents right in front of her to keep them from eating her alive! It breaks my heart to see all these people suffering, and I wonder, can we Kurzicks afford to simply stand by and watch? Is this what the gods would want us to do? Even if the plague never reaches Kurzick lands, do we not have a duty to help? For generations we have lived protected lives in our stuffy old towers. We don't make a move without months of careful prayer and deliberation. Well, personally, I'm sick of it! The time for careful deliberation is past!\"''\n\

  :'''Redemptor Karl:''' ''\"You'll do no such thing, Danika!\"''\n\

  '''Redemptor Karl'''\n\
  :''\"The gods are very wise; I should have seen the signs, but I was admittedly short-sighted. We shall allow you to retrieve the Urn of Saint Viktor, and in return you shall help us with a little \"problem\" we've had with the zu Heltzer cathedral. Of course, we must still discuss all of the details...with someone of repute. I have heard that Mhenlo is with you. The zu Heltzer family owes him a great debt of gratitude for something he did for us ages ago. Bring him to House zu Heltzer, and we shall finalize our deal. When you are ready to travel there, speak with the Lift Operator. He will be expecting you.\"''\n\n\

  ==Quest information==\n\
  ===Objectives===\n\
  * Defeat the [[Emissary of Dhuum (Necromancer)|Emissary of Dhuum]] and close the gateway to the Jahai Bluffs.\n\
  * See Neersi for your reward.\n\n\
  ===Reward===\n\
  * 2,500 [[Experience]]\n\
  * 200 [[Gold]]\n\
  * [[Inscribed Secret]]\n\n\
  ==Walkthrough==\n\
  [[Gate of the Nightfallen Lands]] is the best starting point for this quest, since the objective is just outside the outpost.  The [[Emissary of Dhuum (Necromancer)|Emissary of Dhuum]] appears to be alone, but when the party comes close enough, a large mob of torment creatures will spawn.  However, there appears to be a delay in this spawn, so a fast party can eliminate the Emissary before they appear.  Also, they only spawn when the spot is approached.  A party using only ranged attacks or pulling the Emissary away can eliminate him easily without dealing with the spawn.\n\n\
  ==Dialogue==\n\
  ===Initial dialogue===\n\
  '''Neersi'''\n\
  :''\"Ahai, <player name>. I have just received grave news. Servants of the fallen god Dhuum have been working with Abaddon's minions for some time. But the '''servants of Dhuum''' have recently been seen near a strange tomb in '''Nightfallen Jahai'''. If you've been out there, you know Nightfallen Jahai is rapidly changing to resemble it's counterpart in Elona. As the planes grow closer together it will become possible to open portals between the worlds and cause the real Jahai to fall into night. I fear the history of dark magic associated with this tomb will allow the Avatar of Dhuum to open such a portal to the Jahai Bluffs and stage an invasion. Someone must journey to the tomb and put a stop to this invasion.\"''\n\
  :'''Accept:''' This definitely bears investigation.\n\
  :'''Decline:''' I still have nightmares of my first trip through the Jahai Bluffs.\n\
  :'''When asked about quest:''' ''\"Have you discovered what the '''servants of Dhuum''' are doing at the tomb in '''Nightfallen Jahai'''?\"''\n\n\
  ===Intermediate dialogue===\n\
  :'''Emissary of Dhuum:''' ''\"Defend the portal!\"''\n\n\
  ===Reward dialogue===\n\
  '''Neersi'''\n\
  :''\"Well done, <player name>. That's one less fallen god Elona must worry about. But, I fear the battle that still lies ahead of you will be quite a bit harder. Perhaps this will help in your quest to defeat Abaddon.\"''\n\n\
  ==Notes==\n\
  * It's worth noting that only the Emissary has to be defeated to complete this quest, the additional [[mob]] can be ignored in favour of focusing fire on the creature.\n\
  * Combines well with [[Good Demon Hunting]].\n\
  * This quest is the easiest means to capture the elite skill [[Jagged Bones]], which the Emissary possesses."

  }}
  
  Having completed the trials for [[Ascension]], you must now seek out the ancient dragon, [[Glint]]. She will tell you how to strike back at the [[White Mantle]] as well as tell you who their masters really are. 
  
  ==Mission information==
  
  ===Objectives===
  Gain audience with the prophet Glint.
  *Defeat the [[Facet of Light]]. 
  *Defeat the [[Facet of Nature]]. 
  *Defeat the [[Facet of Chaos]]. 
  *Defeat the [[Facet of Darkness]]. 
  *Defeat the [[Facet of Elements]]. 
  *Defeat the [[Facet of Strength]]. 
  *'''Bonus''' Defeat Glint. 
  
  ==Walkthrough==
  To reach Glint, you must pass through six chambers, each representing one of the core [[profession]]s. Four of these rooms have a global [[Environment Effect|environmental effect]] to hinder players from reaching the Facet at the opposite end of the chamber. Each Facet represents one profession, and when defeated  opens a portal to the next chamber. The order of the chambers is always the same. The portal to the first Facet's chamber is opened after a player talks with the [[Forgotten Gate Keeper]].
  
  ===Facet of Light===
  While in this room, all players suffer from [[Domain of Health Draining]], causing -3 [[health degeneration]]. As a result healers must be constantly active, and group-healing spells such as [[Heal Party]] are useful to help combat the effect. Luckily, the foes you face in this room are not difficult. As with the desert missions, [[Forgotten Sage]]s should be the priority target. You'll also fight [[Enchanted Sword]] and [[Enchanted Hammer|Hammer]] pairs. Typically, players follow the western edge of the room, sometimes avoiding a few foes. Try to kill off the groups before engaging the [[Facet of Light]] boss. It uses [[Shield of Regeneration]] and [[Guardian]] as its primary defense. An enchantment removal or simple overwhelming [[DPS]] should drop it fast, opening the next room.
  
  ===Facet of Nature===
  The health degeneration effect is now replaced with [[Domain of Slow]], causing all players to move slower. In this room, you'll fight numerous [[Enchanted Bow]]s, many of which start up on ledges. However, a [[Longbow|long]]/[[flatbow]] shot usually will cause them to run around to lower ground. Again, it is common for players to hug the left wall when going through this room to attempt to avoid a group or two. The [[Facet of Nature]] uses [[Melandru's Resilience]], so either avoid using weak [[hex]]es/[[condition]]s or have a player prepared with [[Wild Blow]] (or [[Wild Strike]]/[[Wild Throw]]).
  
  ===Facet of Chaos===
  This room has no global effect. Instead, you'll fight swarms of [[Crystal Spider]]s with [[Forgotten Illusionist]]s backing them up. The spiders spam [[Shatter Enchantment]] and [[Hex Breaker]], so it's usually best to avoid using hexes and [[enchantment]]s with them around. Also try to keep out of the Illusionist's [[Chaos Storm]] as it isn't always easy to see its visual effect. The back of the room is a twisted path to the [[Facet of Chaos]]. Pairs of Illusionists will cast across the low walls of the path, but projectile attacks can reach them.
  
  ===Facet of Darkness===
  Players suffer from [[Domain of Energy Draining]], resulting in -1 energy degeneration in this room. Also, players and foes alike are kept under a low powered [[Death Nova]]. The [[Rock-Eater Scarab]]s like to use [[Frenzy]], making them die fast. If many die at once, the damage from the Death Novas can add up if players are grouped up. Also, [[Forgotten Cursebearer]]s will use the corpses to heal, but they shouldn't pose much of a threat. Thanks to the constant Death Nova, weapons and armor with a bonus while enchanted will be nice here, and [[minion]] armies can make this room very quick. Skills such as [[Shatter Enchantment]] are guaranteed to find a target, while [[Mystic Regeneration]] will benefit from the extra enchantment. The [[Facet of Darkness]] in the back is quite easy. [[Dismiss Condition]] is also especially useful here for removing the [[poison]] acquired from Death Nova, while providing extra healing to cover what health was lost thanks to the Death Nova enchantment.
  
  ===Facet of Elements===
  While there are no global effects in this room, you'll run across unavoidable [[ward]]-looking things that cause common elementalist [[AoE]] spells ([[Eruption]], [[Fire Storm]], [[Maelstrom]] and [[Chain Lightning]]) to players in them. Try not to stand in them while fighting. [[Crystal Guardian]]s guard the halls here and carry a nasty [[Shock]]/[[Aftershock]] combo. Luckily, they rarely use the combo in the correct sequence. [[Forgotten Arcanist]]s will often be in side rooms, intercepting players in the main corridor as they pass by. Defeat the [[Facet of Elements]] at the back to proceed to the last Facet.
  
  ===Facet of Strength===
  The global effect here is that every 20 seconds or so, all players are knocked down for 5 seconds. This proves very annoying, although skills such as [[Balanced Stance]] and [[Dolyak Signet]] will prevent the knockdown. Mostly, you'll fight Sword/Hammer pairs, although you may run into a group with a Crystal Spider and Crystal Guardian in it as well. Kill the Guardians first, as Aftershock is much more likely to deal its extra damage while the healers are helpless on the ground. Defeat the [[Facet of Strength]] to finally meet Glint.
  
  ===Bonus===
  The bonus to this mission is unique in that even if the entire party die while attempting the bonus, they will still receive credit for the mission and continue to [[Droknar's Forge]]. So unless you are attempting for the [[Survivor]] [[title]], there is little reason not to try. To begin the bonus, do not enter the portal opened during Glint's cinematic. Instead, pick up one of the [[Dragon Egg]]s in her lair. She will turn hostile towards the party. Defeat her for the bonus.
  
  Since Glint is friendly until the eggs are touched, [[trap]]s and [[spirit]]s can be placed for heavy damage as soon as she turns against the party.
  
  Glint has a unique assortment of skills. She usually begins the battle by casting [[Crystal Haze]], a nasty hex that will leave all casters with [[exhaustion]] unless they are careful. [[Revealed Hex]]/[[Inspired Hex]] are great at removing it, as with all monster skill hexes, they are not replaced and recharge instantly. Casters should try to spread out before the start of battle, allowing some to avoid the hex. Beware if using henchmen and heroes, as they may easily cast themselves dry of energy if left to their own devices.
  
  Glint hits hard, and she will use [[Jagged Crystal Skin]] to cause massive damage to melee fighters. However, the skin is a stance and thus can be removed with [[Wild Blow]], [[Wild Strike]], or [[Wild Throw]]. Also, since it only triggers on physical damage, using elemental weapons or under [[Greater Conflagration]] will negate its effects. If using henchmen, [[Little Thom]] does have Wild Blow, so he should be taken in preference over [[Stefan]].
  
  She also will use [[Crystal Bonds]], but this should not be too problematic as long as your party doesn't rely on enchantments too much. Self-targeting enchantments such as those used by dervishes are not affected, so it primariy inhibits protection monks.
  
  Half way during the battle, she will use [[Crystal Hibernation]], granting health regeneration and a [[Reversal of Fortune]] effect against non-physical damage. It is difficult to kill her under this, but it has a long, five-second activation, leaving it wide open for [[interrupt]]s. Just be sure your interrupt can target non-spell skills.
  
  ===Skill recommendations===
  *Bring a mix of skills. Regenerative enchantments may help in the Facet of Light's room, but it will be detrimental in the Facet of Chaos's room and unreliable if fighting Glint.
  *Very few foes leave corpses, so it is not recommended to rely on them. However, [[Well of Blood]] can prove useful with the occasional corpse.
  *If fighting Glint, make sure someone at least has an interrupt to prevent Crystal Hibernation. This will make the battle much easier.
  *[[Wild Blow]] comes in handy when fighting the ranger and warrior facets as well as against Glint.
  *[[Signet of Capture]] is common, as the Facets are the only place in Tyria to gain the elite skills they carry (with the exception of Melandru's Resiliance which is also used by a [[titan]] boss during [[The Titan Source]]). However, all but [[Gladiator's Defense]] and [[Melandru's Resilience]] are core skills and can be found in other campaigns.

  Protect the [[Forever Tree]]s in the Eternal Grove by ensuring that the [[Tree Singer]]s are able to complete their ritual through the [[Luxon]] and [[Afflicted]] attacks.\n\n\
  ==Mission information==\n\n\
  ===Objectives===\n\
  Protect the Forever Trees by keeping the Tree Singers alive. \n\
  *'''Added''' Defeat the Afflicted forces. \n\n\
  ===Reward===\n\
  {{Mission reward\n\
  | objective = Tree Singers remaining\n\
  | standard = 1 - 5\n\
  | expert = 6 - 11\n\
  | master = 12 }}\n\n\
  ==Walkthrough==\n\
  As you enter this mission note the additional health display which shows the health status of the three Forever Trees. The trees are located at the points 1, 2 and 3 on the map. There are four Tree Singers grouped around each tree - each singer contributes for one quarter of the tree's hitpoints. As the singers take damage the tree will also take damage, if a singer dies the tree is permanently damaged by a quarter. If all four singers of one tree are dead the tree will be also. Only one tree singer/tree needs to survive the mission to complete it.\n\n\
  The mission is fought in a small area at the hill where the trees are situated. The hill is covered by the [[Aura of the Grove]] environmental effect, which provide a speed boost while in the area which makes it attractive to stage any battles on the hill and to run over the hill rather than around it. Most of the foes in the mission will approach the hill but it is sometimes advantageous or neccessary to leave it and engage them outside. Talking to the [[Juggernaut]]s in the area causes them to follow you and assist you during the fight. While close to a Juggernaut, you will benefit from the [[Aura of the Juggernaut]] (which boosts your energy regeneration). The hill has only two entrances, through which opponents can get to the Tree Singers. A good tactic is for the party to split up in two balanced groups of 4 players (or [[hero]]es, if available; note that this split team tactic is very difficult with henchmen), one guarding each gate. \n\n\
  Both [[Mhenlo]] and [[Danika]] are present as allied mission NPCs. They will heal the party, but you will have no control over them whatsoever and they cannot be resurrected, should they die. Their death does not result in a failure of the mission.\n\n\
  ===Luxon attack===\n\
  Initially, Luxons will attack from all sides, coming down the paths from the north, west and south. Usually they will attack from one or two sides simultaneously. Engage them and dispatch them quickly as you see them coming. Especially take care not to let any [[Luxon Elementalist]]s or [[Luxon Warrior]]s slip through to the tree singers, as they can kill them very quickly. [[Luxon Ranger]]s are only a minor threat. During the siege, two [[Siege Turtle]] will approach from each side, their arrival will be announced. The turtles will start firing once they arrive on the small hills, marked with an X on the map. Usually, you should be able to take them out before that. But it is not a problem if a turtle gets a couple of shots out, the tree singers can survive that.\n\n\
  If you run a split team, wait outside the fort to intercept the Luxons as early as possible. Otherwise stay in the central area so you don't have to run back and forth long distances and only go out of the fort for quick hit-and-run attacks on the turtles.\n\n\
  ===Afflicted attack===\n\
  After you have beaten the Luxons, you will be attacked by Afflicted. This part is similar to the Luxon attack but the Afflicted are more difficult to defeat. The hand full of Luxons that have joined to help you since the cutscene will not make up for this. The Afflicted have no siege attack so it is best to stay on the hill. Again, if possible, split the team and attempt to block both entrances to the grove. Do not forget to use the Juggernauts! If you find yourself overwhelmed, focus on protecting a particular tree against the assault, instead of trying to protect all of them.\n\n\
  The Afflicted will always attack both gates simultaneously (exept for the last wave), but the strength of the waves varies. With the second wave, the southern gate will be attacked by [[the Afflicted Maaka]]. If you run a split team, the northern gate will usually be clear quickly, while the southern team may struggle to stay alive. In that case, the northern team should hurry to assist them. The final wave will be accompanied by [[the Afflicted Xenxo]] and [[The Afflicted Senku|Senku]] and will attack the northern gate. The southern group should circle around the hill on the outside and attack this group from behind, taking down the [[ritualist]]s quickly.\n\n\
  ===Skill recommendations===\n\
  *Team based damage reduction, such as [[Shelter]], can be very useful as it applies to your NPC allies too\n\
  *A [[Minion Master]] can provide a lot of disposable targets for Luxons and particularly the Afflicted to attack ''instead'' of the Tree Singers. ''Two'' minion masters are recommended for a split team.\n\
  *For split team tactics, long range skills such as [[Heal Party]], [[Aegis]] or necromancer's [[orders]] can be helpful.\n\
  *[[Trap]]ping at the entrances to the hill area can be effective.\n\n\

For example, Service NPCs (collectors, merchants, etc) and many non-hostile NPCs (including allies but not henchmen party members) each have their own species category separate from both each other and players.
  *This is particularly lethal to a [[minion]] based [[necromancer]] as most of their minions will already be below the 90% health requisite due to their innate [[health degeneration]].
  *[[Dwayna's Sorrow]] is a good counter but with limited range and effect.

  ==In-game description==
  Long before the [[Great House]]s formed the [[Council of Nobles]] and the [[Kurzick]] nation, '''Amatz Basin''' was the site of a fierce battle between the [[House zu Heltzer (Great House)|zu Heltzers]] and the [[House Vasburg|Vasburgs]]. What they fought over, none can remember, but the fighting took a terrible toll. Even worse (from the Kurzick perspective), thousands of the dead were left to rot where they fell. In recent years, the bones of those fallen warriors have begun to resurface, and the Kurzicks blame [[Urgoz]], a corrupted forest spirit, for their ghastly exhumations.
  
  ==How to get there==
  From [[Vasburg Armory]], exit to southwest into [[The Eternal Grove]] and follow the road southwest then southeast into [[Mourning Veil Falls]]. Continue in a south by southwest direction to reach Amatz Basin.
  
  Alternatively, travel southwest from [[Durheim Archives]] across the breadth of Mourning Veil Falls

  ==Trivia==
  This mission was named after the guild [[Guild:The Amazon Basin|The Amazon Basin]]. As part of the reward for the hard work of a select number of members on the Factions official strategy guide, [[ArenaNet]] named the challenge mission in honor of the guild. Note that the guild [[Guild:Zealots of Shiverpeak|Zealots of Shiverpeak]] received an equal reward in having the challenge mission [[Zos Shivros Channel (outpost)|Zos Shivros Channel]] named after them.

  '''[[Skill trainer]]s'''
  *[[Xu Fengxia]] ([[Ran Musu Gardens]])
  
  ==Notes==
  *At a glance, a maximum of +3 health regeneration doesn't sound like a lot, but consider that this effect affects all [[ally|allies]] within range. That includes non-party-members such as allied [[NPC]]s ([[Master Togo]], [[Mhenlo]], etc.), [[minion]]s, [[animal companion]]s and, in case of two-party-cooperative-missions, members of the ''other'' party. 
  
  *At level 12 Recuperation causes +3 health regen for 39 seconds, that means a maximum of 234 points of healing per affected ally. With only 2 allies affected that's already an energy efficiency of 30+ health per energy. For comparison: The avergage monk healing spell has an energy efficiency of around 20. The efficiency increases further with more allies affected. With a full party affected, plus a few NPCs, minions, pets or even an allied party, the energy efficiency can reach values that beat ''any'' monk healing spell! 
  
  *This makes Recuperation a most effective way of healing especially for missions like [[Vizunah Square]], [[Gyala Hatchery]] or [[The Eternal Grove]].

  A celestial storm forms at target [[foe]]'s location for 15 seconds. All foes [[in the area]] take 40 [[damage]] each second.
  
  ==Acquisition==
  This skill is temporarily acquired by [[Primary profession|primary]] elementalists by talking to [[Kuunavang]] in [[Raisu Palace]], [[Imperial Sanctum]] or [[Raisu Palace (explorable area)]].
  
  ==Notes==
  *The skill actually strikes for 40 damage four times every second, in effect striking for 160 damage per second. Additionally, the skill description suggests that the damage is armor ignoring, when, in fact, it is reduced by armor. Exactly 1 pulse per second inflicts [[Lightning damage]], exactly 1 pulse per second inflicts [[Cold damage]], and some of the pulses inflict [[Fire damage]], the other pulses inflict unknown types of [[Elemental damage]], presumedly [[Earth damage]].

  In order to properly construct a monument to the citizens of Ascalon who were killed during the Searing, Symon the Scribe needs a census.\n\n\

  * Find the [[Ascalon Census]] in the ruins in [[Old Ascalon]].\n\

  ==Walkthrough==\n\
  Leave Ascalon City.  Head southwest under the bridge past [[Warmaster Grast]].  Veer to the left past [[Ambassador Zain]]'s little camp down into the ditch and continue heading southwest.  You'll face off against some gargoyles and devourers, but if you take on the groups one at a time, you'll have no problems getting to the chest containing the census.\n\n\
  Once you have the census in hand, go back to Ascalon City and give it to [[Symon the Scribe]].\n\n\
  ==Dialogue==\n\n\
  ===Initial dialogue===\n\
  '''Symon the Scribe'''\n\
  :''\"King Adelbern has commissioned a monument to those who died in the Searing.  I am compiling a list of the names of the fallen, but I don't have all the records I need.

  :''\"You found the census!  Oh, I'm most...grateful to you.  I almost said I was delighted, but one look at this list...so many lost.  If we took a census today, the list wouldn't be half this long.\"''\n\n\

  Received from Gardener Pohsin (in [[Vehtendi Valley]])
  
  ==Quest information==
  ===Objectives===
  *Lead Gardener Pohsin safely to the Hanging Gardens of Jahin.
  *See Gardener Pohsin for your reward.
  
  ===Reward===
  *2,000 [[Experience]]
  *250 [[Gold]]
  *[[Trade Contract]]
  Accept: You're in luck.  My job is to help people in need.<BR>
  Reject: Time to file for unemployment.
  
  ==Walkthrough==
  This is a routine escort type quest, simply ensure that the npc Pohsin stays alive while you take him across Ventendi Valley (point 1 to point 2 on the map).  Creatures you're likely to encounter are Kournan soldiers (usually with a margonite), heket and some plant type mobs
  The initial quest objective can be approached from either [[Honur Hill]] or [[The Kodash Bazaar|the Kodash Bazaar]].  Going from Honur Hill will take you through Yahnur Market, and while this isn't an often frequented outpost, it does have a skill trainer who may be worth seeing on your way through.
  
  ==Dialogue==
  ===Quest Summary===
  Gardener Pohsin: ''I took a job at the Hanging Gardens of Jahin, across the river.  Today is my first day.  But there are all manner of creatures out there that would love to use my thighbone as a toothpick! As you can see, I'm a gardener, not a fighter.  Please '''protect me''' on my journey.  Once I meet up with the workers, I can work my schedule to travel with others to and from the job.''
  
  
  ===Reward Dialogue===
  Gardener Pohsin: If it weren't for you, I'd have never made it to my job...alive, anyway.  Thank you so much.  Here, take this. You've certainly earned it.
  
  ==Notes==
  This quest can easily be picked up while performing the [[The Role of a Lifetime|Role of a Lifetime]] quest for [[Norgu]], and completed afterwards before leaving Vehtendi Valley.  Gardener Pohsin does not appear to use any skills, but will use his bow to fight anything the party attacks.
  
  If Pohsin dies, then the quest fails. You will have to return to an outpost, then return back to the '''starting point''' to accompany Pohsin again.

  Having [[ascend]]ed, and with the truth behind the [[White Mantle]] and their [[Mursaat]] masters revealed, it's time to strike back. The leaders of the [[Shining Blade]], [[Evennia]] and [[Saidra]] have been condemned to death. Break them free of their cell and escape to a boat prepared by your [[Deldrimor Dwarves|Deldrimor]] allies.
  
  ==Objectives==
  Rescue Evennia
  
  *Find a way into the holding area. 
  *Break Evennia out of her cell. 
  *Escape with Evennia to the awaiting ice ship. 
  *'''Bonus''' Return news of Rornak Stonesledge to Hamdor Grandaxe.
  
  ==Skill recommendations==
  *If your armor is not [[infusion | infused]] and you plan on fighting Mursaat, necromancer [[minion]]s and ritualist [[spirit]]s can help soak up some of the deadly [[Spectral Agony]] they use.
  
  ==Walkthrough==
  Upon entering, you'll see a few [[Ice Imp]]s and [[Pinesoul]]s scattered around. These shouldn't prove very difficult to defeat. Much more dangerous is the patrol of [[Mursaat Elementalist]]s that circle the area. If you haven't fought Mursaat (or their Jade constructs) before, they have a unique skill called [[Spectral Agony]] that will cause massive damage to anyone without [[infuse]]d armor (which is most likely the case the first time through this mission). Avoid heading straight north to avoid the catapult fire, instead, head northeast through a [[Stone Summit]] group (containing a boss) towards the icy river. Don't cross the bridge just yet, as it is under heavy fire from catapults. Continue past the bridge and you'll see more Stone Summit and an engineer. Killing this engineer won't do much to help now (other then a [[morale]] boost). Head north of the engineer to find a second engineer. Kill him and pull the lever he guarded. You'll see in a cutscene how the shot incites a [[dolyak]] stampede, crushing the ballista operators that were bombarding the bridge. 
  
  Head back to the bridge and up the hill. You'll fight a few groups of [[White Mantle]]. Proceed all the way to the northeast and you'll find a door familiar from previous missions in the [[Northern Shiverpeaks]]. You know what that means. The powder lies west of the door; drop it in front of the door to open the way into the cave. The cave is occupied by White Mantle which should prove little resistance. Beware of the Mursaat and Jade that linger on the west side of the cave. If not attempting the bonus, you should avoid them. Head southeast to exit the cave into what looks like a mining quarry. Mursaat Elementalists patrol the center, so the easiest way to get to the prison cells is through the small cave to the east. You'll run into groups of weak White Mantle that can be easily dispatched. Exiting the cave, the cells should be visible to the south. Run past them to find conveniently placed powder kegs to blast the doors open. Opening the cell, you'll see a cutscene where Saidra sacrifices herself to allow you to escape with Evennia. Evennia must survive the rest of the mission.
  
  Use another keg to blast open the door nearby the cells. The short cave opens to an icy sea with a narrow path leading north and a bunch of Mursaat Elementalists to the south. As soon as you approach, the Mursaat will begin to move down the path.
  
  {{bug|A little while after the first Stone Summit group this mob of Mursaat passes, there is a Shiverpeak Chest which the Mursaat sometimes will get stuck on and stop moving. If this happens, you will have to retry the mission or attempt to have an infused player pull them away from it.}}
  You can either try to outrun them or let them pass. If you try to outrun them, you will still have to fight most of the Stone Summit, as Evennia tends to stop to fight them herself. If you get caught by the Mursaat, chances of survival are quite low. The easier method is to approach until the Mursaat start to move, then pull back into the cave to let them pass. Follow a distance behind, allowing them to clear out the Stone Summit they encoutner. Eventually, they will all be killed by catapult fire. Regardless of which method you choose, simply follow the path until you reach the Deldrimor dwarves and their ice ship. The mission is complete as soon as Evennia approaches the ship.
  
  ===Bonus===
  After blasting open the first door to the ice cave, you'll notice a number of Jade and Mursaat along the western areas of the cave. The southern group of Jade Armor and Mursaat Elementalists protects another blastable door. Try to kill the Jade fast before their Spectral Agony tears the group to shreds. Having expendable targets such as [[minion]]s and [[spirit]]s helps, as they will occasionally target these instead of the rest of the party. Also, any [[hero]]es automatically come with infused armor, thus will take only a slight amount of damage from their skill. Past the door, you'll fight a few White Mantle until you get to a cell holding [[Rornak Stonesledge]] (point 1) captive. You may use another powder keg to free him, but sometimes you can talk with him without the extra hassle. Talk to him to initiate the bonus.
  
  After you free [[Evennia]] and get to the part with the horde of Mursaat Elementalists, you'll notice [[Hamdor Grandaxe]] standing a distance behind the Mursaat (point 2). To complete the bonus, you need a party member to talk to him. The easiest way is to let the Mursaat walk by, allowing you to walk over unhindered. But, you can choose to fight through them or run past them if your really wish.
  
  You can actually talk to the dwarves in either order. Should you choose to talk to Hamdor first, you will gain credit for the bonus upon talking with Rornak.

  In either case, you will need to defeat an [[Eidolon]] then bring the dropped [[Spectral Essence]] to a [[Seer]]. In the Iron Mines mission, they are about 2/3rds the way through the mission. In the Mineral Springs, they are in the far east in the back of the Ice Imp cave.

Bodyguard: |-
  {{NPC infobox
  | species = Human

  In every [[GvG]] battle, the defending and opposing teams have a bodyguard to serve them and their [[Guild Lord]]. Opposing teams will usually attempt to defeat the body guard before moving on to the Guild Lord. This is mostly due to their ability to heal the Guild Lord, making him much harder to take down.
  
  Like all GvG NPCs (with the exception of the [[Guild Thief]]) the Bodyguards do not respawn. With their ability to heal the Guild Lord, their high damage attacks, and only 480 health, keeping the bodyguard alive is a top priority during battle.

  The players complete this mission to become [[Weh no Su]] to be able to see and fight beings from the spirit realm in the mortal realm. This mission is the [[Ascension]] of the Factions campaign.\n\n\
  ==Mission information==\n\n\
  ===Objectives===\n\
  Defeat the Celestial creatures to become [[Weh no Su|Closer to the Stars]].\n\
  * Defeat [[Kaijun Don]], the Celestial Kirin.\n\
  * Defeat [[Kuonghsang]], the Celestial Turtle.\n\
  * Defeat [[Hai Jii]], the Celestial Phoenix.\n\
  * Defeat [[Tahmu]], the Celestial Dragon.\n\n\

  | hardmstr = < 40}}\n\n\
  ==Walkthrough==\n\
  The primary goal of the mission is to defeat the four celestial beings, bringing the player Closer to the Stars.  The celestials spawn at predetermined points on the map, marked by the green stars.\n\n\
  :Location 1: [[Hai Jii]] - Phoenix ({{Me}}Mesmer)\n\
  :Location 2: [[Tahmu]] - Dragon ({{E}}Elementalist)\n\
  :Location 3: [[Kuonghsang]] - Turtle ({{N}}Necromancer)\n\
  :Location 4: [[Kaijun Don]] - Kirin ({{Mo}}Monk)\n\n\
  Once the celestials are killed, they will spawn multiple essences throughout the mission area.  These essences have a similar skill set as the celestials and should be treated in much the same way.  They will also respawn after a while when killed, making retreating and regrouping if you get into trouble problematic at best.\n\n\
  The four bosses can be defeated in any order.  However, if you are looking for the master's reward, it is recommended that you work backwards from 4 to 1, starting with Kaijun Don and ending with Hai Jii.  Therefore, when the portals appear, you should take the one farthest to the left.\n\n\
  The mission area is swarming with Star Tengu.  You will encounter three varieties of Tengu during the mission: Star Blades ({{W}}Warrior), Star Sentinels ({{r}}Ranger) and Star Lights ({{Rt}}Ritualist).  All of the Tengu in this mission are level 20 and, as such, are fairly harmless when dealt with in a reasonable manner but can take down a group quickly if too many are aggroed at once. '''Careful aggro is the key to success in this mission.'''\n\n\
  ===Kaijun Don===\n\
  Kaijun Don is a Smiting {{Mo}}Monk, not a healer as many people mistakenly believe.  As such, he is fairly harmless, but can overwhelm groups if he swarms in with the Star Tengu patrols surrounding him.  Be cautious of rushing into battle with him, as his Elite skill {{skill icon|Signet of Judgment}} will knock you down.  It is generally a good idea to take out as many of the Star Tengu patrols around him as you can before aggroing Kaijun Don.  Once in the battle, focus your fire on him and he will go down quickly.\n\n\
  ===Kuonghsang===\n\
  Kuonghsang can be dangerous if not taken out quickly.  He uses the elite skill {{skill icon|Grenth's Balance}} and can quickly take down your HP if you're not careful.  In addition, you will have several Star Tengu and Essences of Kirin to deal with, so plan your aggro accordingly.  When he goes down he will spawn several Essences of Turtle who are just as annoying as he is.  From this point on forward it is generally a good idea to focus on the turtle essences as your first target.\n\n\
  ===Tahmu===\n\
  Tahmu is a dangerous Air {{E}}Elementalist.  He has the elite skill {{skill icon|Lightning Surge}}, a hex spell which will probably knock you down unexpectedly at least once during the fight.  Hex removal, therefore, is a plus, but it can sometimes be difficult to watch for a party member being targeted with the spell.  A better idea is to simply pay attention to the party's health meters and heal accordingly, as Tahmu can do a good bit of spike damage.  He seems to have a fair bit of HP, and he has regenerative capabilities in {{skill icon|Aura of Restoration}}, so once aggroed it is a good idea to focus fire on him.\n\n\
  Notice on the map that the path suddenly heads north after defeating Tahmu.  In reality, there are two paths to get to Hai Jii.  The northern path, while a bit longer distance-wise, makes up for it with the fact that there are fewer enemies to be fought.  If you're going for the master's reward, this can easily shave two or three minutes off of your time when compared to the \"obvious\" path.  A good tip would be to check your time in the map at this point (either with a clock or by typing /age and checking the total time in the current map).  If you're around 17 or 18 minutes, you shouldn't have to rush too much; anything more than that and you'll need to keep a careful eye on the clock.\n\n\
  ===Hai Jii===\n\
  Hai Jii is a potent {{Me}}Mesmer and can give the healers in your party a lot of headaches.  A good suggestion is to watch for the group that Hai Jii spawns with.  Once you see the group, have the entire party focus their attacks on the phoenix.  The mission ends and goes to a cutscene immediately after Hai Jii dies, even if there are still enemies attacking.  This can be useful when you're running low on time and want to make the master's reward.\n\n\
  ===Skill recommendations===\n\
  *Stance removal could help shorten the battles against the Star Sentinels, as it will negate {{skill icon|Lightning Reflexes}}.\n\
  *Hex removal could also be useful in the battles with Tahmu, Hai Jii, and their essences.\n\
  *{{W}}Warriors: Bring some form of +damage that does not depend on the enemy suffering from a condition.  {{skill icon|Sever Artery}}/{{skill icon|Gash}} is a decent combo for the Tengu but the celestials are unaffected by {{skill icon|bleeding}}.  Good examples include {{skill icon|Power Attack}}, {{skill icon|Dragon Slash}}, {{skill icon|Silverwing Slash}}, etc.  If you're far enough in any of the campaigns, you could consider bringing {{skill icon|Hundred Blades}}. {{W}}Warrior/{{Rt}}Ritualists could utilize {{skill icon|Splinter Weapon}} to great effect, as most of the battles involve huge swarms of enemies.  Combine {{skill icon|Hundred Blades}} and {{skill icon|Splinter Weapon}} for even more fun.\n\
  *{{N}}Necromancers: Minion Masters are useful in this mission.  There is a significant number of exploitable corpses available, so it is possible to maintain a full complement of minions. Alternatively, a Minion Master can do the mission in reverse and have a full complement of minions before the turtles. Make sure to get to the corpses before the turtle essences exploit them for their wells. Also bear in mind that the Celestials (and their Essences) do not leave corpses.\n\
  *{{E}}Elementalists: Area of Effect nuking could be very effective here, as most enemies stay fairly close together.\n\
  *{{Me}}Mesmers: Interrupting will be of significant benefit as all four bosses are casters.\n\n\

  Retrieve the urn of Saint Viktor and safely leave the cathedral.
  
  ==Mission information==
  
  ===Objectives===
  Retrieve the sacred [[Urn of Saint Viktor]] and deliver it to [[Mhenlo]].
  *Escort Danika to the door of the cathedral so she can open it.
  *Clear the cathedral of the guardians binding the Urn of Saint Viktor. 
  *Collect the Urn of Saint Viktor
  *'''Added''' Make your way out of the cathedral! Defeat the guardian Stone Souls.
  *Mhenlo must survive
  
  ===Reward===
  {{Mission reward
  | objective = Time taken (minutes)
  | standard = > 35
  | expert = < 35
  | master = < 30 }}
  ''Note: You will also get 500 [[Kurzick faction]] points upon completion of this mission, regardless of time taken.''
  
  ==Walkthrough==
  Follow the road to the rear gate of Arborstone Cathedral (1 on the map). You will find mixed groups of Warden in this area. Some of the giant mushrooms emit Stone Spores.
  
  After a short dialog, Danika will open the gate, allowing the party into the cathedral. In order to be able to pick up the Urn of Saint Viktor(2), you first have to defeat five groups of Warden. The group on top of the stairs will include two Warden of Earth, two ritualists and a boss (either Ryver Mossplanter or Milefaun Mindflayer). Take heed not to accidentally aggro it while fighting one of the other groups on the stairs.
  
  After you pick up the urn, a cinematic will play and Mhenlo will be trapped outside the building, leaving the party and Danika to escape through the collapsing cathedral.  The party will be back at the stairs where they entered the cathedral. Stone Rains and Stone Reapers will spawn in front of the group.
  
  From the cinematic on, fragments of the building fall at a regular rate, causing minor damage to the whole party and interrupting skills and attacks. 
  
  Several areas of the cathedral have the environmental effect [[Cathedral Collapse]], in which the above described effect will occur more frequently. You should avoid fighting in those areas whenever possible, especially when with henchmen. If party members should die in such an area, henchmen healers will often be unable to resurrect them, as they are unable to time their spells right so that they are not interrupted.
  
  There are three routes between the cathedral sanctum to the atrium and exit(3):
  #The southernmost route (purple path on the map) is populated mainly by large, coordinated and balanced teams of Dredge, which can be quite difficult to defeat. If you choose to take this path, be sure your team is similarly coordinated. This path is guarded by the boss Dark Fang. On this path, many groups of Dredge are found near each other. It is advised to pull them away from one another, though the person who pulls should be fairly durable, as [[Dredge Gutter]]s will often shadow step to that person.
  #The northernmost route (yellow path on the map) is populated by large groups of Undergrowths, some Stone Scale Kirins and Dragon Mosses. There are a few hidden Stone Reapers and Stone Crushers that will come to life as soon as the party comes close. The largest danger, however, are several groups of Oni. This path is guarded by the boss The Ancient.
  #The recommended center route (green path on the map), which is the shortest, easiest and fastest.  It is populated primarily by Wardens and Stone Guardians.  And towards the end some dangerous Oni. Only this route is detailed here.
  
  ===Through the middle===
  Proceed upward via the stairs from where you defeated the Warden boss. At the end of the stairs, a pair of hidden Stone Reapers will come to life and behind those a group of Wardens is waiting. Dispatch them quickly and move on to the left. If you linger here, another group of Warden will come at you from the right. 
  
  It is recommended to cross the cathedral hall from the left, as here the collapsing areas are placed slightly different and less unpleasant than on the right. Fight your way through some groups of Wardens until you reach the stairs leading down to the main hall floor. 
  
  From now on you have to be cautious due to the increase in the frequency of cathedral collapses and the number of hidden spawns.  There are two groups of Wardens patrolling the main hall floor and two hidden Stone Rains at the bottom of the stairs so take care not to over-aggro.  If you are lucky you can slip past many of the Wardens populating the hall.  To guarantee success for the stairs out of the area clear the Warden groups which you might aggro before approaching.
  
  At the stairs out of the main hall floor there are two groups of Oni.  Combined with the collapses they can give a difficult fight.  The first group appears as you fight the Wardens in the room, the second appear right at the top of the stairs.  For the second group there is a small patch on the topmost part of the stairs which is not collapsing. You should be about on it when the Oni reveal themselves. Wait there for them to engage you, do not charge up at them, as this would mean you would have to fight in a collapsing area. 
  
  As you clear the top of the stairs several Stone Rains, two Stone Reapers and one Stone Soul will  emerge and gather around the boss Stone Judge. Try to intercept and take down one or two of the Stone Rains spawning next to you before they can join the group. Eliminate the regular mobs and then the boss to allow Danika to start the ritual for opening the door.  Two Stone Crushers will awaken next to the door. Prevent them from attacking Danika, as their attacks will interrupt her ritual. When the door opens the mission ends.
  
  ===Skill recommendations===
  * Use fast casting and skills with short activation to avoid interruption from cathedral collapse
  * Skills that prevent interruption, like [[Mantra of Resolve]] or [[Glyph of Concentration]]
  * Anti-melee skills for the Oni and the Stone Judge boss.
  * Remember to use the [[Urn of Saint Viktor]] for its damage reduction. A caster should carry the urn and drop it every so often for the protective effect. Remember to pick up the urn after each fight as Danika will not follow the party while the urn is on the ground.

  Hunt down the [[Kournan]]s in Vehjin Mines and prevent them from opening the ancient coffer of [[Palawa Joko]]. When you have aquired the coffer, pass the scriptures in it to the Master of Whispers.\n\n\
  ==Quest information==\n\
  ===Requirements===\n\
  Required Hero: Master of Whispers\n\n\
  ===Objectives===\n\
  * Locate the ancient coffer of Palawa Joko.\n\
  * Eleminate all hostiles and secure the coffer.\n\
  * Obtain the Scriptures of Abaddon from the ancient coffer.\n\
  * See Belgun the Quarry Master for your reward.\n\n\

  * 250 [[Gold]]\n\
  * 10 [[Lightbringer]] points\n\
  * [[Trade Contract]]\n\n\
  ==Walkthrough==\n\
  Follow your quest pointer to find Jenahn and the [[Ancient Coffer]]. They are located in the north-west corner of Vehjin Mines, so if you already have the [[Basalt Grotto]] mapped, it is much quicker to start from there.\n\n\
  The area around the Coffer is patrolled by several groups of Margonites and Kournans, and as you approach the Coffer, Jenahn will open it for the Kournans and be killed for his trouble.  After defeating the groups in the area around the Coffer, click on it to recover the scriptures of Abaddon for the Master of Whispers, then speak to Belgun for your reward.\n\n\
  ==Dialogue==\n\
  ===Initial dialogue===\n\
  '''Belgun the Quarry Master'''\n\
  :''\"Few are privy to this information. Consider yourself honored.\"''\n\n\
  :''\"The Order of Whispers is a secret society led by the Master of Whispers. Members of our order have sworn an oath to protect the dark secrets held in these mines.\"''\n\n\
  :''\"We must move quickly. The Kournan troops have already discovered one of Palawa Joko's ancient coffers, which they believe houses the scriptures of Abaddon. Fortunately for us, the only miners around here that would have the expertise to open such a coffer are me and Jenahn. Nevertheless, we must find the '''coffer''' and take it from the '''Kournans''' before they devise a way to open it. Are you prepared to strike?\"''\n\
  :'''Accept:''' ''\"The Kournans must be stopped! Who knows what vile evil lurks inside the coffer?\"''\n\
  :'''Decline:''' ''\"Nobody knows what junk is inside that trunk, and I'm not about to find out.\"''\n\
  :'''When asked about quest:''' ''\"We must hurry! The Kournans may open the '''coffer''' at any minute!\"''\n\n\
  ===Intermediate dialogue (after reaching Jenahn)===\n\
  :'''Kournan Guard:''' ''\"Open the ancient coffer for us, and Warmarshal Ossa will guarantee you rewards beyond your wildest dreams. The paperwork is already worked out, you lucky stiff.\"''\n\
  :'''Assistant Jenahn:''' ''\"Finally! You have no idea what it's like to handle precious gems with your bare hands by day, then go home at night a pauper with nary enough to feed yourself. Step aside. Yes, I recognize this type of container. I've opened many just like it. There we'll go... and done!\"''\n\n\
  :'''Assistant Jenahn:''' ''\"By the gods, what have I done! May Lyssa forgive me.\"''\n\n\
  ===Intermediate dialogue (after clearing the area)===\n\
  :'''Master of Whispers:''' ''\"What secrets are contained here that Varesh seeks these scriptures? Here, let me see.\"''\n\n\
  ===Reward dialogue===\n\
  '''Belgun the Quarry Master'''\n\
  :''\"The Order of Whispers is indebted to you. Had these scriptures reached the Warmarshal, who knows what catastrophe might have ensued? Jenahn, though far from perfect, did not deserve such a foul end. Remember what you saw here today. Should you fail to stop Varesh Ossa, we will all share a similar fate.\"''\n\n\
  ==Notes==\n\
  *{{Skill icon|Lightbringer's Gaze}} is useful against the [[Margonite]]s.\n\
  *If you don't want to fight through [[Vehjin Mines]], start from [[Basalt Grotto]].\n\
  *BUG: If you have the Scriptures of Abaddon in your inventory, after map travel and re-entering [[Vehjin Mines]], the quest will show only the first objective, but can be completed."

  ==Notes==
  *This skill will only activate if you do not currently have an animal companion.
  *Once used, your animal companion will stay with you in combat areas as long as you have this skill on your skill bar unless you turn it in to a [[pet tamer]].
  *Once this skill is activated the target animal will become hostile and attack.  Beware that your [[Henchmen]], [[Hero]]es, or party does not attack it or it may die before the skill is complete.
  *Once an animal companion is charmed and in a combat area, ranks in Beast Mastery will not effect this skill but will increase the base damage output of your animal companion and lessen the skill bar black out time received upon your animal companion's death.
  *[[PvP]]-only characters who equip this skill will always get an [[Elder]] [[Wolf]] when entering combat areas.
  *The only animals you can charm while hostile before charmed are the Wolf and the [[Black Bear]] in [[Pre-searing]] and the [[Aggressive]] [[Lion]]s/[[Lioness]]es in [[Jahai Bluffs]].
  *This skill can be replaced with a new skill, via learning a new skill or gaining a mission's skill, without losing control of the pet. In explorable areas, the pet will no longer appear with you once you change zones if you still have the skill.
  *By bringing this skill you can activate the [[pet control panel]] by clicking the number next to it's name in the [[party window]].
  *See also [[Animal companion]].

  [[Evennia]] is free, and the treachorous [[Markis]] isn't far. Seek out the [[Seer]] to find how to [[infusion | infuse]] your armor to protect against the Mursaat's deadly [[Spectral Agony]]. Then track down Markis and avenge [[Saidra]].
  
  ==Objectives==
  Kill Markis and his Jade Armor guards.
  
  *Find the Seer. 
  *'''Added''' Kill the Eidolon. 
  *'''Added''' Deliver the Spectral Essence to the Seer to infuse your armor. 
  *'''Bonus''' Defeat The Inquisitor before he leaves with the information about the Shining Blade.
  
  ==Skill recommendations==
  *You'll be facing knockdowns from giants and [[Signet of Judgment]], so a skill such as [[Balanced Stance]] may help keep you on your feet.
  *If attempting the bonus, [[snare]]s and knockdowns may help keep [[The Inquisitor]] from running away.
  
  ==Walkthrough==
  Upon entering, you'll see a battle between the [[White Mantle]] and the [[Stone Summit]]. You may choose to kill off both groups or run by them altogether. If you do not have [[infusion | infused]] armor (or don't feel like fighting Mursaat), follow the red path under the bridge Markis runs across. If you take the green one, you will run into a group of Mursaat that will use [[Spectral Agony]] to tear you to pieces if your armor isn't infused. Follow this path, taking out groups of [[Tundra Giant]]s, [[Azure Shadow]]s, and [[Mountain Troll]]s until you run into more White Mantle.
  
  From here, the path to the right is probably easier. It leads to small groups of White Mantle and a [[White Mantle Engineer]] who can be killed to cease the ballista fire nearby and gain an easy morale boost. Circle down the hill that had the engineer, under the bridge, and kill the Stone Summit boss in the icy field. Continue north and you should see a White Mantle encampment raining down ballista fire. You'll hear [[Shining Blade Scout Ryder]] call out for help, but there isn't anything you can do to assist him at this time. Keep to the left here to avoid the ballista hits and take out the other Stone Summit boss. Follow the path north of the encampment and plow through more trolls, shadows, and giants. You will eventually come to a forked bridge that is under fire from ballistas. You'll have to run across, keeping to the left towards the [[Blessed Griffon]]s in the distance. Continue up this path and you should eventually find an ice cave with the [[Seer]], marked "S" on the map. Approach him for a cutscene where he instructs you to kill the nearby [[Eidolon]] so he can use its [[Spectral Essence]] to infuse your armor.
  
  The Eidolon is in the ice cave, east of where the Seer is located, at the "E". You'll have to cut down a number of shadows to get to it, but it shouldn't be too difficult to find and deafeat. Have someone carry the Spectral Essence it drops back to the Seer. All players should then talk to the Seer to have every piece of armor they are wearing infused. This will dramatically improve your chances of survival when fighting Mursaat.
  
  Exit the cave to the north, and you'll see a group of White Mantle and Mursaat. follow the path, fighting multiple groups such as this until you reach the fort Markis is hiding in. If you wish to complete the bonus as well, you'll have to do it first and come back, as killing Markis and his gaurds completes the mission. Depending on your party setup, you might be able to take out each of the two guard patrols along the walls without aggroing the other. If you must enter the fort to engage them, you will aggro both groups, so make sure anyone doing so keeps to the walls to avoid engaging Markis as well. Once the guards are defeated, Markis appears to be alone, but if you approach him, the statues around him will break open, becoming [[Jade Armor]]. With proper pulling techniques, Markis can be pulled away from the statues and defeated without activating the Jade. Then the statues can be approached one at a time so the Jade can be easily dispatched. Keep in mind, if any player wishes to capture [[Barrage]] from Markis, the mission ends after he and his four Jade Armor guards are defeated, so make sure they do so before the Jade are all destroyed.
  
  ===Bonus===
  It is highly recommended that players have infused armor to attempt the bonus, as you will run across multiple groups of Mursaat. To begin the bonus, a player must talk to [[Shining Blade Scout Ryder]] located inside the White Mantle encampment, marked with a "B". However, there is no front access to the fort, so the party must work its way around. Ryder will tell the party to kill [[The Inquisitor]] before it reaches a portal in the north. Accepting the bonus will cause the Inquistor and a few [[Mursaat Mesmer]] guards to spawn just to the north. From there, they will travel north towards the portal. Clear out mobs that might get in the way before talking to Ryder.
  
  If the party has infused armor at the beginning of the mission, they may choose to simply follow the Markis across the bridge after the initial White Mantle/Stone Summit battle is. Follow the green path, and you'll find yourself inside the fort with Ryder. However, it would probably be best to pass him by and clear the path the Inquisitor will follow (the yellow path to the north) before talking to Ryder.
  
  If the party is coming from the Seer, it can backtrack to the besieged bridge, this time taking the other fork towards the siege engineers and heading south. Or, the party can continue past Markis and his fort circling around and back south through a number of Mursaat and White Mantle. Either way, try to kill whatever is in your path, thus cearing the way when the Inquisitor later appears.
  
  Have all but one member of the party stand north of Ryder while the last party member talks to him to start the bonus. Quickly kill off the mesmer guards then focus on the Inquisitor. [[Snare]]s and knockdowns should help keep it from getting too far. If your party lacks these skills, it can also be body blocked to delay its northern progress.

  ==Notes==
  *The mission can be complete quickly if a player can run all the way to the cutscene with the Seer. To accomplish this, take a speed-enhancing shout such as [["Charge!"]] which can be used simultaneously with [[Balanced Stance]] when running past giants and shadows. This is very popular for infusion runs, where the sole purpose for playing the mission is for players to get their armor infused.

  The Door of Komalie is not far off. Establish a foothold on the island and begin to work your way towards it.
  
  ==Objectives==
  Establish a foothold on the Ring of Fire Island Chain
  
  *Gain access to the Citadel Guardhouse 
  *Open the main gate to the Citadel Guardhouse 
  *Clear the Guardhouse of [[Mursaat]] 
  *'''Bonus''' Kill the [[Eidolon]]. 
  
  ==Skill recommendations==
  Depending on which route you take, you may need plan accordingly. 
  *Taking the front gate places the party against numerous Mursaat and Jade along with [[Ether Seal]]s. Prepare for energy drain when in the area of the seals. Seals also regenerate, so ensure the party has sufficient [[DPS]] to take them out.
  *The back route is filled with [[Lava Spitter]]s with their annoying interrupts and dodging stances along with [[Lava Imp]]s packing strong fire spells such as [[Meteor Shower]] and [[Rodgort's Invocation]]. Stance-removing or block-ignoring skills help with the spiders, while interrupts (especially mass-interrupts such as [[Cry of Frustration]] or [[Maelstrom]]) help with the imps. 
  
  ==Walkthrough==
  You'll begin by watching [[Brechnar Ironhammer]] lure the Mursaat away from you. Do ''not'' engage them and they will go away. You cannot save Ironhammer, as he is scripted to die without even being attacked. Head northeast, following the coast. It's best to wait in the corner before engaging the Mursaat in order to take out the patrol of Jade which will inevitably catch up to you anyways. 
  
  Clear the [[Mursaat_Elementalist|Mursaat Elementalists]] and [[Mursaat Mesmer|Mesmers]] and to the top of a hill looking down upon a [[Mursaat Tower]] and a number of [[Jade Bow]]s. Keep the party on the hill while a player uses a long/flat bow to pull the Jade away from the tower. If done correctly, the Jade should be able to be defeated with only melee players entering the draining effects of the tower. Once the Jade are clear, rush the [[Ether Seal]] to deactivate the tower. Sometimes, a pair of [[Nightmare]]s will spawn from the ground around the tower. From here, the easy way from here is to continue up the northern path, avoiding the [[Drake]]s. You may choose to fight them and battle the [[Igneous Ettin]]s through the cave, but it is entirely unecessary. 
  
  To your left, you'll eventually see a lava pool with a group or two of ettins waiting on the other side. Occasionally, the ettins will engage the Mursaat and lose, but usually, you will have to deal with them yourself. Either pull the ettins across the lava or have the team rush to the other side to battle them. It is not recommended to fight them while standing in the lava if you can help it. If you rush across, try not to engage the Mursaat by the tower until everyone is healed and ready. From here, you can either have a player rush past the tower to trigger a cutscene on the other side (and moving the party past the tower) or attempt to defeat the forces there (recommended for the bonus). As before, if you wish to fight, pull the foes away from the tower, defeat them, then finish off the seal.
  
  [[Vizier Khilbron]] appears and warns the party the front gate is heavily guarded and that it might be better to take the back route. However, with proper pulling techniques, the front gate is often easier to tackle then facing the fire spewing, lava-loving foes encountered along the back route. Either way, you must first push through a few groups of [[Breeze Keeper]]s.
  
  ===Front Gate===
  The front gate is guarded by numerous Mursaat and towers. The hill along the right side facing the gate gives enough height for most bows as well as attacking Ritualist [[spirit]]s to hit the rightmost [[Ether Seal]] as well as pull the patrols of Mursaat away from the towers. After the Mursaat patrols are clear, take out the frontmost towers. If your party has sufficient capability of dealing damage without line-of-sight, you can also clear a number of the Mursaat patrols from behind the gate as well. When ready, break the gate seals to open the gate. 
  
  Two more mursaat towers stand a distance behind the gate, but their effective radii overlap just past the stairs. If you haven't cleared the roaming patrols, have someone use a bow to pull them to the stairs to be defeated. The Ether Seals on these two towers face away from the gate, so the safest way to approach them is to run past them and to the right (keeping away from the mursaat that may be back there). Stand just outside the range of the rightmost tower to heal and regenerate energy. If there are Mursaat dangerously nearby, engage them now so they don't become a problem later. Once everyone is healed, take out the right tower followed by the left. If the bonus has been initiated, an [[Eidolon]] will appear at this time and should be easily dispatched.
  
  Now that the draining towers are out of the way, break the seal to the level for the main gate and defeat the boss guarding it. Touch the lever to open the main gate. Clear out any remaining Mursaat and proceed down the bridge. Follow the path to the final Mursaat boss. Defeat it and the nearby Mesmers to complete the mission.
  
  ===Back Road===
  You should see a lone [[Lava Spitter]] marking the entrance to the back road. Following this path, you'll be confronted by many more spitters. Their [[Incendiary Arrows]] interrupt constantly, so keep healers away from their line of sight if possible. They also use dodging stances when low on health, so skills such as [[Wild Blow]] are useful for finishing them quickly. Keep an eye on the spider patrols when the cave opens up, as it is not uncommon to aggro more spiders then you would like.
  
  Past the spiders, you'll find numerous [[Lava Imp]]s. They have strong [[nuking]] capabilities, especially in groups. Luckily, they tend to bunch together, making interrupts such as [[Cry of Frustration]] or [[Maelstrom]] effective in mitigating the damage. They are have relatively low armor thus fall quickly if the party isn't being rained on with meteors. Watch the compass carefully to avoid the attention of extra imp patrols while fighting a group.
  
  Following the path, you'll run across numerous pools of lava, dotted with islands guarded by imps. Keep pushing through to finally reach an Ether Seal to open the guard house. Clear out the Mursaat inside, break the seal to a room containing a level, and defeat the boss guarding it. Touch the lever to open the main gate. Clear out any remaining Mursaat and proceed down the bridge. Follow the path to the final Mursaat boss. Defeat it and the nearby Mesmers to complete the mission.
  
  ===Bonus===
  To activate the bonus, you'll need to talk to an [[Ancient Seer]] in the cave east of the first lava pool. While you can reach him by fighting through the drakes and ettins on the southern side, you can easily just fight the ettins on the northern side and work your way back to him. The Seer will tell you to bring him the [[Spectral Essense]] from an [[Eidolon]] who will only appear once the towers to the guard house are deactivated.
  
  Across the lava pool, make sure to defeat the Mursaat and Ether Seal just before the cutscene, as you will need to be coming back through here, carrying an item (thus slowing your movement).  The bonus requires you to enter through the front gate, so there is no reason to attempt the back road. As soon as all the towers are destroyed, the Eidolon will appear. Defeat it and have someone run all the way back to the Seer to complete the bonus. Note, you may use this Seer to [[infuse]] armor.

  ==Notes==
  *In spite of what the Vizier says, most players find the front gate easier then the back route. However, the back road is the only place to find [[Incendiary Arrows]] and a second breeze keeper boss lies back there in case the first did not have a desired elite skill.
  *After the bonus is complete, players may use the seer to [[infusion|infuse]] [[armor]]. However, it is much easier to infuse armor in the [[Iron Mines of Moladune]].
  *The Ettin bosses share two spawn points, one of them will spawn at each point.
  *The Mursaat and Jade bosses share three spawn points, two of the six bosses will spawn at each point.
  *The "Rider" bosses share two spawn points. One of the three bosses will spawn at each point, with one of the three not spawning.

  == Notes ==
  * This skill can work on enemy spirits. However, good candidates for your spirits are [[Bloodsong]] (since it will heal back the damage), and [[Life]] (since it will be dying soon anyway).
  * Like [[Infuse Health]], this skill is good for healing huge amounts of damage at once. Unlike Infuse, your character does not personally have to sacrifice life.
  * This spell works on the nearest spirit, not necessarily one [[nearby]] or in [[earshot]]. In fact, the range is slightly outside of earshot, making it useful even in the remote vicinity of a spirit.
  *Target ally will gain the following amount of health for various levels of '''Restoration Magic''':

  In every [[GvG]] match, each team has two Knights near the [[Guild Lord]]. On the whole, Knights are of very little value to the battle. Their attacks are fairly weak, and they are very easy to pull away from the Guild Lord and defeat.

  '''Luxon Priests''' can grant players who have more [[Luxon faction]] than [[Kurzick faction]] a [[blessing]] that gives +25 max [[health]], (this ends when one leaves the area).

  *Whilst the allure of bringing up two minions at once may seem quite appealing, you need to have a good number of points in both [[Soul Reaping]] and [[Death Magic]] to make them effective. \n\
  *In the early stages of the game, if you can maximize your [[energy]] then they can be useful: the ability to create a small army of minions in a short space of time may help a player to get through some of the slightly tougher parts of both [[Ascalon]] and the [[Northern Shiverpeaks]].\n\
  *As you progress through the game the limiting factor with bone minions is the fact that you can\xE2\x80\x99t get them to a high enough level to be truly effective and the benefit that you get of creating two at a time disappears as they will die much faster.\n\
  *Bone minions are useful with skill combinations that rely on the minions dying, such as in when combining this spell with [[Death Nova]], [[Putrid Flesh]] or [[Feast for the Dead]].\n\
  *This spell will trigger [[Explosive Growth]], [[Boon of Creation]], and [[Spirit's Gift]] twice.\n\n\

  [[Rotscale]] is a mighty [[Bone Dragon|bone dragon]]. After its death, its corpse was reanimated in [[Ascalon]] by the [[Stone Summit]]. It began a trek through the [[Shiverpeak Mountains]] back to Kryta, where many adventuers attempted to slay it. It eventually made it to the border of the [[Maguuma Jungle]], where it built a nest in [[Majesty's Rest]].
  
  More recently, several [[Rotting Dragon]]s have appeared near Rotscale, with an entourage of [[Smoke Phantom]]s. Rumours persist that a powerful and valuable object, perhaps a weapon, lies within the tomb it now guards zealously...
  Rotscale is a powerful dragon found in the swamps of Kryta. Although it looks like a [[Bone Dragon]] it does not take double damage from [[Holy damage]] like undead creatures do. He is not a boss, but can drop a [[Unique]] weapon.

  ==Trivia==
  *There used to be a boss called Rotscale in [[Sanctum Cay]]. This boss has since been renamed to simply "[[Bone Dragon (boss)|Bone Dragon]]" to prevent confusion.
  *Rotscale is one of the oldest creatures in [[Tyria]] - both in a [[lore]] sense and a game design sense. The dragon has been around since the early [[beta]]s in 2004, where there was [[Slay Rotscale|a quest]] near the [[The Frost Gate (outpost)|Frost Gate]] (since removed) in which the player had to kill it.

  [[Glint]] is a [[dragon]] prophet that is over 3000 years old. She was the first creature placed on the continent of [[Tyria]], by the [[Gods of Tyria|Gods]] to oversee the new world. As time went on, she was given servants - The [[Forgotten]] to aid her in this task.
  
  Her lair is said by [[Turai Ossa]] to be located within a single grain of sand in the vast [[Crystal Desert]]. ''"One could search the desert for a million lifetimes and never find her."''
  
  As the caretaker of Tyria, she foretells of events in the future, like an Oracle, and shows great concern for the [[Flameseeker Prophecies]], which she learned of about 800 years ago. In [[The Dragon's Lair (Mission)|The Dragon's Lair]], she tells players of their destiny and sends them to the [[Southern Shiverpeaks]]. As the bonus for The Dragon's Lair, players may attempt to defeat her in a battle. This is one of the hardest fights in the game for an unprepared group, though victory over her does not appear to affect the story in any way, nor her attitude towards the players. Later, following the demise of the [[Lich Lord]] at the end of [[Hell's Precipice (mission)|Hell's Precipice]], a vision of her appears to congratulate the players and whisk the [[Scepter of Orr]] off to an unknown location.
  
  A [[Vision of Glint]] can be summoned in [[Droknar's Forge]] to receive guidance from the oracle and to receive the [[Titan Quests]].
  
  A [[Statue of Glint]] can be found in the [[Salt Flats]].

  * [[Bringer of Deceit]] ([[Domain of Pain]])
  
  ==Notes==
  *This skill is more effective on low-cost quickly recharging skills, as the loss of healing will be minimal. For example, with a Healing Prayers of 12, using '''Healer's Covenant''' in combination with [[Orison of Healing]] will change the spell so it has a casting cost of 2 and heals for 45 health. However, when used with [[Heal Other]] the healing is reduced to 113 but the cost of the skill only reduced to 7. 
  *This results in a net loss of energy for the same amount of healing.

One of them, '''[[Mhenlo]]''', I think he said his name was, left a message for you to meet up with them.  He was a nice enough fellow, but I was a little distracted by that sassy little blonde he had with him.\"''\n\

  ===Intermediate dialogue 1===\n\
  '''Brother Mhenlo'''\n\
  :''\"Welcome to Cantha, old friends.  I had hoped that with the Charr pushed back toward their homeland, we all might enjoy some peace and quiet, but I supposed I should have known better... I'd recieved word from my former teacher, Master Togo, that a plague had been spreading throughout Cantha, but I had no idea the extent of its destruction.  With Dwayna's guidance and Balthazar's fortitude, perhaps we can help Master Togo discover what is causing this sickness and put an end to it.\"''\n\n\
  ===Intermediate dialogue 2===\n\
  :'''Brother Mhenlo''': ''\"Be wary: this part of the city is home to countless dens of thieves, petty assassins, and other unsavory characters.\"''\n\

  :'''Brother Mhenlo''':  ''\"I'm afraid to discover what damage the plague has wrought upon this land.  I doubt any force could be more destructive than the Charr, yet the urgency of Master Togo's letter makes me think I may be wrong.\"''\n\n\
  ===Intermediate dialogue 3===\n\
  :'''Emi''':  ''\"Mhenlo!  We have been looking all over for you!\"''\n\

  :'''Brother Mhenlo''':  ''\"That both Master Togo and the Oracle of the Mists are so concerned over this situation tells me all I need to know, friends.  Truly there are dark forces at work in Cantha.  I will do all in my power to help put an end to them.  I hope I can count on your help.\"''\n\

  '''The Turtle Champion''' is respected and honored throughout the [[Luxon]] territories for his courage, his profound sense of justice, and his aweinspiring power on the battlefield. He was the first Luxon Champion to earn his title in mortal combat that ended without the death of either combatant. Argo\xE2\x80\x99s opponent, [[Tullus]], had fought bravely, and continued to keep his guard defiantly up even after the bloody loss of a foot and many other injuries. Rather than strike Tullus down as the crowd demanded, Argo simply declared himself the victor and handed Tullus his sword. The gesture allowed his foe to leave the arena alive and with honor intact, but was a clear indication of Argo\xE2\x80\x99s victory\xE2\x80\x94to hand over his weapon showed that the future champion had nothing to fear. Justice was served, the bloodlust of the crowd was relatively satisfied, and this noble act earned Argo the admiration of all the clans. Even the [[Kurzick]]s honor Argo\xE2\x80\x99s bravery and skill, as a foe against whom they themselves can hope to prove worthy. \n\n\
  Even more than the Luxons\xE2\x80\x99 traditional enemies, Argo carries generations of hatred in his heart for the [[Cantha]]n Empire, which he, and many Luxons, believe has kept his people cornered in the most desolated section of the continent, [[the Jade Sea]]. Yet as much as he despises the Canthan Empire, the continent is still his home. And when threats arise that no one faction can face alone, Argo might be convinced to join forces with the Kurzicks\xE2\x80\x94and perhaps even with the Canthan oppressors\xE2\x80\x94to fight for the survival of all.\n\n\

First, common foes to not possess the necessary Energy to charge the Signet. It will work only on those who possess exceptional power. You will recognize such foes by their '''colored auras'''. After you have defeated a worthy foe, simply stand near that foe and use the Signet of Capture. Any nearby foes who are sufficiently powerful will be affected by the Signet, which will then transform itself into the single skill of your choosing. There are some exceptionally powerful skills that may only be gained in this manner, so this Signet is a very valuable resource.\n\n\

She broke with her criminal gang when that organization embraced the Canthan Plague as a \"gift of the gods.\" Now she is ''mo zing'' - a traveling blade, a masterless assassin, selling her services to the highest bidder. She feels guilty for the disease that overtook her former brothers and sisters, but the one constant in her life has been change.

  The appearance of her armor can be upgraded to [[Ancient armor]] using [[Mysterious Armor Piece]]s acquired from [[the Shadow Nexus]] [[Challenge Mission]].

  }}\n\
  [[General Bayel]] rose through the ranks of [[Kourna]]\xE2\x80\x99s army through dedication, hard work, and ruthless use of force. As an [[Ruins of Ascalon|Ascalonian]], he worked twice as hard to prove himself as many Kournan recruits, demonstrating his resolve and discipline again and again. If he knows the outcome of a battle comes down to his life or someone else\xE2\x80\x99s, he sees nothing wrong with making sure it\xE2\x80\x99s the other soldier who loses. His zeal extends to battles against countless opponents. When the [[Centaur]]s became rebellious, he volunteered to lead the \xE2\x80\x9Cpacification campaign\xE2\x80\x9D against them. When the [[corsair]]s showed a blatant disregard for [[Elona|Elonian]] law, he took pleasure in leading raids against them, taking revenge on behalf of his nation. Overwhelming force has solved many of his greatest problems.\n\n\
  As a result, Bayel is admired in the courts of [[Varesh Ossa|Warmarshal Varesh]], feared by those who serve him, and hated by those who oppose him. His enemies claim that he cares little for \xE2\x80\x9Ccollateral damage,\xE2\x80\x9D that he considers the deaths of civilians a small price to pay for the security of the state. As a ruthlessly efficient war machine, General Bayel will stop at nothing to destroy his enemies once he sets his sights on an objective. Victory demands nothing less than complete dedication.\n\n\

  == General ==
  During each [[GvG]] match, both teams recieve several Archers which defend their base. They are generally quite important to a GvG match, and can easily change the tide of the battle. With 480 health and 80 armor, as well as 7 [[pip|pips]] of health regeneration from Troll Unguent, Archers can be quite difficult to take down.
  
  Archers are mostly situated on walls and other raised areas, where they would have a height advantage against the attackers. Their only attack skill is Pin Down, which is reasonably effective in stopping the attacking team from reaching the [[Guild Lord]]

  | followed by = [[Crossing the Desolation]]
  }}
  [[Koss]] has convinced you that defending the [[Garden of Seborhin]] against the demon hordes is the most worthy way to spend your time because it is of greater benefit to the people of Vabbi than defending [[Melonni]]'s home town.
  
  '''Jennur's Horde''' is a mission which represents a branch in the storyline. Only one of either this mission or, the other view of the story, [[Nundu Bay (Mission)|Nundu Bay]] needs to be completed.  Nundu Bay is generally the preferred option to Jennur's Horde as it is a simpler mission to accomplish.
  
  ==Mission information==
  
  ===Requirements===
  Koss must be in your party to enter this mission.
  
  ===Objectives===
  Defeat the Harbinger of Nightfall before it summons enough demons to destroy Seborhin.
  *Protect the spirits of Seborhin from the onslaught of torment demons.
  *The [[Light of Seborhin]] is the only thing that can harm the harbingers. Drop the Light of Seborhin when you are close enough to an enemy to release its energy.
  *[[Horticulturist Hinon]] must survive.
  * '''Bonus''' Defeat the additional Harbingers. 
  
  ===Reward===
  In this mission, the rewards are based on whether you defeat any of the additional Harbingers.
  {{Mission reward
  | objective = Harbingers defeated
  | standard = 0
  | expert = 1
  | master = 2 }}
  
  ==Walkthrough==
  Once everyone loads in, proceed around the planter and wait for Hinon to create a Light of Seborhin. These are the only items that can be used to defeat the numerous Harbingers including the final Harbinger of Nightfall. Down the initial corridor await three Harbingers. Two lie in the center of the corridor and the third at the top of the stairs at the end. To defeat them, a player must drop a Light of Seborhin in the area of the Harbinger. The Harbinger is then replaced by a Spirit of Seborhin which then will spawn more Light of Seborhin bundles.
  
  Every two minutes, a group of [[Margonite]]s will spawn at the location of the Harbinger of Nightfall and proceed west. As more Harbingers are defeated, these groups will become larger and thus more deadly. As such, some players choose to leave the two Harbingers in the corridor alive to keep the spawn group size smaller.
  
  Past the corridor, the path splits north and south. Static Margonite groups linger around, but once defeated they will not return. Both directions are blocked by a Harbinger, but they both come back around and rejoin.  Again, some players leave these Harbingers alive to keep the spawn size small. Spawned Margonite groups will randomly choose one of the two paths, so players must keep a watchful eye on both sides to ensure a group does not pass by and make its way to Hinon. Should players choose to attempt the bonus, they must defeat the Harbingers located on the stairs branching off from each of the two paths, marked as light blue crosses on the map.
  
  With the paths rejoined, only the Harbinger of Nightfall and a number of Margonites. It takes three Light of Seborhin to defeat this Harbringer. So if there are at least three human players, it is common for them to all rush towards him and defeat him as quickly as possible. If playing with heroes and henchmen, the player(s) must return to a Spirit of Seborhin (or Hinon) for another Light and return.
  
  ===Bonus===
  Kill the additional Harbingers and the Margonite groups they are with.  The groups are located at the top of stairs to the left and right of the Harbinger of Nightfall. The Margonites surrounding the Harbingers must also be defeated to achieve the bonus. Keep an eye out to ensure spawning Margonites do not sneak around the opposite path while attempting to kill the bonus Harbingers.
  
  Key to winning the bonus is not aggroing a stationary group of enemies unless you have just defeated a spawning patrol, thus giving you enough time to finish the stationary group before the next patrol spawns.
  
  ===Skill recommendations===
  *You will be facing hordes of Margonites. [[Lightbringer]] skills may help immensely during the mission.
  *You may want to take a speed boosting skill to intercept the spawning groups, drop Light of Seborhin and run away, or to run past Harbingers you wish to leave alive.
  *With the endless spawns of Margonite, there are numerous corpses, making a [[Minion master]] very useful for this mission.

  *This powerful skill is used exclusively by the dragon [[Glint]] in [[The Dragon's Lair]].

  }}\n\
  It has happened to many new guilds\xE2\x80\x94they put some wins under their belt but then, suddenly, bump into strange maps and start taking losses. Not from a lack of skill, necessarily, but perhaps from a lack of knowledge about the unfamiliar terrain or assorted quirks of these maps. Talking to the [[Canthan Ambassador]] [[NPC]] in the [[Great Temple of Balthazar]] does help to get a basic orientation for each map, but many map features only become active during an actual [[Guild Battle]].\n\n\
  To see active aspects of your own guild hall, you can simply set up a [[scrimmage]] with at least one other person. This will allow you to see all NPC locations, flag spawn points, gate levers, and any item spawn points. To get comfortable with other guild halls will just take time playing on those maps. However, below we will give you some points to consider and tricks you can use as you move into unfamiliar terrain.\n\n\
  ==[[Guild Thief]]==\n\
  Hunter's Isle features a [[Guild Thief]] that is used to open the gate of the opponents base. To use a Guild Thief, one of the human players on your team will have to ''talk'' to the Guild Thief, and it will follow this person around the map until this player ''talks'' with it again.\n\n\
  The Guild Thief has one primary use, which is to open the gates of the opponents base within the 20 minutes of normal GvG play. (At [[VoD]] all gates open, so the Guild Thief is no longer necessary.)\n\n\
  A secondary use for the Guild Thief on this particular map is to stall the opponents [[NPC]]s from their march to the flagstand when [[VoD]] starts at 20 minutes in the game. The player, who the Thief is following, will ''talk'' with it when it is standing close to the main gate into the opponents base. The opponents [[NPC]]s will start to attack the Guild Thief and while doing this, make a good target for the [[Trebuchet]].\n\n\
  ==Trebuchets==\n\
  Hunter's Isle, like [[Warrior's Isle]] and [[Wizard's Isle]] features two [[Trebuchet]]s, that can be used to lay siege to an area inside the base the Trebuchet overlooks. If you fire the Trebuchets at 20:22 you will kill most npc's and the bodyguard.\n\

  Free the spirits of the heroes of ancient Cantha.  Get to Visu before her will fails and she is consumed by Shiro.

  Stop the Spirit Binder from consuming [[Vizu]].
  * You have freed n souls out of 8.
  * [[Master Togo]] must survive.
  * [[Mhenlo]] must survive.

  ==Walkthrough==
  One of the harder factions missions, especially when trying to achieve master's reward. The players have to defeat 8 bosses in 8 separate rooms. Apart from the fact that one can easily get swarmed by the many afflicted, the [[Temple Guardian]]s pose powerful EoE elementalist enemies who can wipe out a party that does not scatter quickly enough.
  
  ===Room 1 (Bound Kitah)===
  Fight the 2 pairs of temple guardians separately from the main group. As with all afflicted, concentrate on their monks and powerful ritualists first.
  
  ===Room 2 (Bound Naku)===
  The groups to the left, right and center can be pulled separately. Most easily by pulling the right group first and back into the walkway, then center and finally left.
  
  ===Room 3 (Bound Teinai)===
  Pulling groups separately is not possible here, but fight the afflicted before engaging Teinai. Be aware of Teinai's [[Sliver Armor]] which can wipe out scores of players close to him at once.
  
  ===Room 4 (Bound Karei)===
  Like in the first room, fight the temple guardians separately from the main group before killing the boss.
  
  ===Room 5 (Bound Jaizhanju)===
  The group to the right can be pulled independently of the main group. Additionally, pulling can make the enemy warriors rush out of range of their healers. Two doors lead to the next room. While it is sufficient to kill the group guarding one door, the other will join in while the players fight in the next group, therefore it is easier to kill both beforehand.
  
  ===Room 6 (Bound Zojun)===
  It is easier to pull the temple guardians separately if taking the left door. Wait for the afflicted patrols to move out, then kill first patrols, then temple guardians, then the main group.
  
  ===Room 7 (Bound Kaolai)===
  Beware of the patrols rushing in on you in this room and watch out for the high powered elementalists.
  
  ===Room 8 (Bound Vizu )===
  Single afflicted rangers patrol this circular room clockwise and anti-clockwise. They, as well as the pairs of temple guardians protecting the bridges to the center, need not be killed to finish the mission. However, do take care of those patrols that might aggro on your backline. While fighting the last group, it is advisable to have your melee fighters pull the big enemy group onto the bridge and body block them there, thus protecting your backline. All enemies in the center need to be killed to finish the mission (even those that might not initially aggro with the rest of the group).
  
  ===Skill recommendations===
  * Since there is a boss to be killed about every 3 minutes, real resses are mostly unneeded and can be replaced by [[Resurrection Signet]]s or [[Sunspear Rebirth Signet]]s.
  * Having a minion master is very advisable, since there are plenty of corpses and the minions form a valuable meat shield to absorbe the [[Afflicted Soul Explosion]].
  * There are plenty of enemies around, AoE works well.
  * Warriors should contemplate bringing some defensive skills, since they will be forced to take the brunt of the attacks in several rooms.

  ===Intro===
  Brother Mhenlo: ''This is a part of Cantha that I wish I had explored more of while I was here in my early years.''
  
  Master Togo: ''Come, let us find Vizu. There is no time to waste!''
  
  Master Togo: ''We do not have much time before Vizu is bound. Perhaps if we free the other spirits, they can lend their strength to Vizu.''
  
  ===Before Kitah===
  Master Togo: ''Kei na Kai! The temple guardians have been awakened!''
  
  ===After Kitah===
  Master Togo: ''Shiro has bound the heroes into these creatures. It is worse than blasphemy: Shiro plays in the fields of the gods!''
  
  Kitah: ''You have released me. I owe you an enormous debt of gratitude.''
  
  Brother Mhenlo: ''Rest assured, Master, we will make him pay for what he has done...and what he plans to do.''
  
  Kitah: ''If anyone can stop Shiro, it is you. Good luck, friends.''
  
  ===Before Naku===
  Master Togo: ''We must proceed with caution. The guardians see us neither as friend or foe, but they will kill us if they perceive we are a threat.''
  
  ===After Naku===
  Master Togo: ''We must destroy each construct to free the soul bound within it.''
  
  Naku: ''I shudder to think what would have happened had you not release me from the Spirit Binder. You have my gratitude. I shall lend my strength to Vizu!''
  
  Brother Mhenlo: ''Binding the Canthan heroes was a clever move by Shiro, but I'm afraid that this is just a taste of what's to come...''
  
  ===Opening Gate===
  Master Togo: ''Quickly! It looks like the constructs are attempting to bind Vizu. We must hurry...we have very little time!''
  
  Master Togo: ''I believe that Vizu has knowledge of Shiro that helped her to take part in his destruction 200 years ago. That knowledge will help us to destroy him once again.''
  
  Bound Vizu: ''Get away from me demons! Ah sang beh!''
  
  Naku: ''Shiro must be stopped. I pray you are successful in this mission.''

  '''Watchman Arad'''\n\
  :''\"I've found something! An entry in the scribe's journal notes that the king often visited one of the priestesses in the '''Temple of the Ages'''. Later, the woman gave birth to a daughter named '''Salma''', who was granted special dispensation from the royal treasury. The king always did take good care of his children, legitimate or not. This woman could be exactly who we are looking for. She has ties to the true gods as well as royal blood! I'm certain that the people would follow her if only she would consent to take the throne. You can travel light and quickly, <player name>. While I make preparations to mobilize the [[Lionguard]], you could go speak with her.\"''\n\n\
  :''\"Will you help me once again my friend?\"''\n\
  :'''Accept:''' ''\"I will go to the Temple of the Ages.\"''\n\
  :'''Decline:''' ''\"I cannot become involved in this.\"''\n\
  :'''When asked about quest:''' ''\"Please journey to the '''Temple of the Ages''' with all speed and speak to '''Salma'''.\"''\n\n\
  ===Intermediate dialogue===\n\
  '''Salma'''\n\
  :''\"Yes, I know about my heritage. My father...the king, was always very kind to me. But when the [[Charr]] attacked, he abandoned my mother, and all of the people of Kryta, in their hour of need. Now you want me to take his place? How can I know if I'll have the strength to lead where he did not? It's a difficult thing you ask of me, and I am uncertain.... Still, if I am the only hope for the Krytan people, then I must trust in myself. Tell Watchman Arad that I will meet with him. I will do what must be done.\"''\n\n\
  ===Reward dialogue===\n\
  '''Watchman Arad'''\n\
  :''\"She will take the throne? This is excellent news, I will mobilize the Lionguard and prepare an escort for her. It will take much work, but Kryta will be reborn! I cannot thank you enough. If only others exhibited the same courage and honor as you, the [[White Mantle]] would have never gained control of Kryta.\"''"

The Hall of Heroes (arena): |-
  {{Arena infobox
  | region = [[The Rift]]
  | victory = Capture Points, Relic Run or King of the Hill
  | party = 8
  }}
  The Hall of Heroes is the final map in the [[Heroes' Ascent]] ladder.  It is possible to skip from other maps, but most players access it through [[The Vault]] or [[Sacred Temples]],
  
  The [[Game updates/20070201|February 1, 2007 update]] changed the map objectives in the Hall of Heroes.  Instead of the traditional altar objective, players will enter this [[mission]] having to complete one of three objectives.
  
  As from [[Game updates/20070329|March 29th]], Heroes' Ascent became an 8v8 battleground. This change is permanent.
  
  Note: There is no [[Death Penalty]] for dying in the Hall of Heroes anymore.
  
  == Objectives ==
  HoH consists of three objectives.
  *King of the Hill
  *Relic Run
  *Capture Points (Similar to [[Alliance Battles]])
  
  === King of the Hill ===
  In a King of the Hill match, each team of 8 players and a [[Ghostly Hero]] must control the central altar on the map for more cumulative time than the other teams.
  *To capture the altar, you must bring your team's [[Ghostly Hero]] to the altar.
  *Your ghost can capture the altar only if the holding team's ghost has been killed.
  *The ghostly hero captures the altar with a [[Skill]] called [[Claim Resource]].  This skill costs nothing to use, takes 2 seconds to cast, and cannot be disabled out via skills such as [[Distracting Shot]] or [[Blackout]].
  *After a team captures the altar, they gain a point every 30 seconds and a [[morale boost]] every 2 minutes after you cap.
  *The team with the most points at the end of the match wins.  If two teams scores are tied, the team who most recently won a point wins the match.
  *Dead party members will be resurrected with full health and energy at their team's base every minute. If their team controls the altar, they will resurrect there instead.
  
  === Relic Run ===
  Like relic runs in [[Unholy Temples]] and [[Sacred Temples]], this objective requires your team to cap more relics than the opposing teams.  Unlike Unholy and Sacred, however, you do not need a Ghostly Hero to capture your relic.  To capture a relic, simply carry it onto the central Altar.  Note that the ghostly hero has no function in this objective (other than the usual d-shot spamming), so attacking enemy ghosts will accomplish nothing on this map.
  *Your team's relic spawns just in front of your base.  You can only pick up your team's relic.
  *Each relic your team brings to the central altar increases your team's points by 1.
  *The team with the most points at the end of the match wins.  If two teams scores are tied, the team who most recently won a point wins the match.
  *Dead party members will be resurrected with full health and energy at their team's base every minute.
  
  === Capture Points ===
  Capture points is like King of the Hill times 4.  One Capture Point is located at each of the three teams' Bases, plus a fourth on the Altar.
  *Each person you bring near a capture point adds one pip of momentum towards capturing that point.  A [[Ghostly Hero]] adds 4 pips.  You can't have more than 4 pips while capturing a shrine.
  *If two teams are competing for a shrine, each pip the controlling team has reduces the enemy's capture momentum by 1 pip.  Therefore, the team with the most people near a given shrine will eventually capture it.
  *Every 30 seconds, each team gains one point for each shrine they control.
  *The team with the most points at the end of the match wins.  If two teams are tied for points and they both control the same amount of shrines, the team who was previously winning is declared the victor.  If two or more teams are tied and one team controls more shrines than the others, that team wins.  If no teams were ever in the lead (nobody ever capped the middle and nobody capped another team's shrine), Blue team wins.
  *Dead party members will be resurrected with full health and energy at their team's base every minute. If their team controls the altar, they will resurrect there instead.

  The Hall of Heroes consists of a central area where the Altar is located.  The central area is connected to Blue Base via a wide corridor opposite of where the [[Victory Chest]] spawns.  On the east and west of the central area are two more corridors, one on each side.  Those corridors lead to Yellow Base and Red Base.  The current locations of Yellow Base and Red Base were previously battlegrounds.  When Hall of Heroes housed up to five teams, the defending team spawned in Blue Base, near the altar, while the other four teams would fight each other on the sides, two on the west side and two on the east.  The victor of each side was then allowed to pass to the central area to fight the holding team.  The Hall of Heroes has since changed, and all teams entering there can proceed directly to the altar.
  
  == Rewards ==
  *When a team is declared the winner, his team gains server wide recognition as his name (or guild name if more than half the team is in the same guild) is spammed across GuildWars reading:
  "(Name or Guild Name) has won a battle in the Hall of Heroes and keeps the [[Favor of the Gods]] for (region)."
  *If their region did not already have favor, it will say:
  "(Name or Guild Name) has won a battle in the Hall of Heroes.  To take the [[Favor of the Gods]] away from (holding region), (challenging region) must win X more times."
  *It takes five wins in a row for a region to gain the Favor of the Gods.  Note that five different teams from the same region may win favor; it is not required for one team to win five times in a row.
  *A [[Victory Chest]] spawns on the ledge behind the Altar.  Each player on the winning team may open it once.  Many of the items gained from the chest are exclusive to winning Hall of Heroes, and are thus extremely rare.  
  *The winning team gains [[Fame]] for winning the Hall of Heroes.  The amount of fame given can be found at [[Fame]].  Also see [[Rank]].
  *The winning team also gains 800 [[Balthazar Faction]] for winning halls, plus an extra 100 if they achieve a Flawless Victory, meaning nobody on their team was killed.
  
  == Notes ==
  * [[Kill Count]] is a game type that was once in HoH rotation but has since been removed.

  To complete the quest simply follow the quest marker in the outpost and speak with each witness. Return to Inspector Caleb. Upon speaking with Inspector Caleb the player will discover that he has been... replaced. \n\n\
  ==Dialogue==\n\
  ===Initial dialogue===\n\
  '''Inspector Caleb'''\n\
  :''\"I have a matter that I need some discreet help with. Three days ago in '''Bergen Hot Springs''', two members of the Lionguard were brutally slain. Initial evidence suggests that it was the work of the Shining Blade, but something strange is going on. There were four '''witnesses''' but none of them would speak with me when I interviewed them. I believe that at least one of them might be willing to talk to someone who is a little less \"official.\" An outsider, so to speak. I would be grateful if you would travel to Bergen and obtain '''written testimonies''' from the four witnesses.\"''\n\n\
  :''\"Will you help me?\"''\n\n\
  :'''Accept:''' ''\"I would be glad to help.\"''\n\
  :'''Decline:''' ''\"This isn't my problem.\"''\n\
  :'''When asked about quest:''' ''\"Start the investigation by obtaining a '''written testimony''' from '''Andar D'Leod'''. He is located in '''Bergen Hot Springs.'''\"''\n\n\
  ===Intermediate dialogue===\n\
  <!-- for dialogue in windows -->\n\
  '''Andar D'Leod'''\n\
  :''\"Why would I speak with someone like you? This is a Krytan matter, and I'll not speak to a foreigner about it. You can deliver that message to your Inspector Caleb if you like.\"''\n\
  '''Dannel Smythe'''\n\
  :''\"Who sent you? I've already told Caleb that I didn't see anything or anyone. All I know is I was standing here minding my own business when i heard a shriek. I looked up, and I saw the two Lionguard lying in a pool of blood. Why don't you ask that Ascalon woman if she saw anything, because I didn't see anyone and definitely not any... I just didn't see anything. That's all I have to say.\"''\n\
  '''Penelope Randell'''\n\
  :''\"It's good to see a friendly face. I didn't want to speak to that inspector because I wasn't sure about speaking to a Krytan. I came to the springs to get water to take back to the Settlement when I saw the two Lionguard arguing with several of those White Mantle soldiers. Things were getting pretty heated when the Mantle said something about \"righteous judgment\" coming for the Lionguard just like all the other infidels. I left at that point to take care of some other business, but then later, when I heard that the Lionguard were found dead, I just knew it had to be the Mantle.\"''\n\
  '''Layman Josef'''\n\
  :''\"I'll tell you what happened alright! It was the Shining Blade. Those murderers were trying to extort protection fees from the merchants hwere when the Lionguard showed up and tried to arrest them. Those Shining Blade murderers just cut them down without thinking twice about it. That's the truth.\"''\n\
  '''Inspector Caleb'''\n\
  :''\"Ah you're back...well...I...I have been...replaced as the investigator on this matter. You should speak with Inquisitor Gilead. He's in charge now.\"''\n\n\
  ===Reward dialogue===\n\
  '''Inquisitor Gilead'''\n\
  :''\"I'll take those papers from you. Thank you for your help. The Lionguard is obviously undermanned, so the White Mantle will be taking over the investigation. Your service to the people of Kryta has been noted.\"''\n\n\
  ==Notes==\n\
  If the player doesn't have Bergen Hot Springs yet, be prepared to encounter some [[Undead]] foes along the way."

  ==Notes==
  *The damage taken by the foe is [[armor]]-ignoring.
  *As this is an [[Enchantment]], items and skills which extend enchantment durations will affect it but it is also subject to enchantment removal skills by enemies.
  *As it is the enchantment causing the foe to take damage and not the weapon itself the character may wield a [[melee weapon]] of any [[attribute]] requirement without the enchantment damage being reduced. 
  *"Attack in melee" only requires you to have swung your weapon at your target to inflict the damage, therefore [[blindness]], [[miss]]ing and [[block]]ing skills cannot prevent the damage being inflicted.
  *The damage suffered by the foe is not reduced by skills such as [[Flurry]] as it is the enchantment and not the weapon that is the damage source.
  *This attack will not end skills that require a successful attack (such as [[Dark Escape]] or [[Feigned Neutrality]]).
  {{anomaly|In addition to preventing damage, melee attacks made while under the effects of '''Illusionary Weaponry''' are not considered to hit, miss or fail to hit.}}

  :''"Welcome to the front. The Luxons are pushing into our territory and attempting to gain ground. Get out there and teach those mangy Luxons a lesson they won't soon fonget!"''
  :''"Any questions?"''
  '''Conversation options''':
  :Give me a brief summary of the objectives
  ::''"The goal here is to amass 500 points before the other team."''
  ::''"You gain points by killing opposing players and maintaining possession over [[control point]]s, of which there are 7 in total. Of the 7 total control points, there are 4 dfferent types: 2 resurrection shrines, 2 defensive points, 2 attack points, and a dragon roost."''
  :Explain how to capture key points.
  ::''"A control point is captured when your team outnumbers the enemy players within range of the contested location."''
  ::''"While capturing, there are 4 rates of change: 1 additional player (approximately 20 seconds to change the paint state), 3 additional players (approximately 11 seconds to change the point state), and 4 or more additional players (approximately 8 seconds to change the point stage)."''
  ::''"As long as your aggro circle overlaps the control point, you are counted as a catpuring team member."''
  ::''"Capture points have 3 states: enemy control, neutral control, and friendly control."''
  ::''"Finally, pets, minions, Spirits and so on are excluded from capturing control points."''
  :Inform me about the [[resurrection shrine]]s.
  ::''"Resurrection shrines allow you to revive closer tothe battlefield. Catpure of a shrine will spawn an NPC Monk to help maintain control. Once the monk is dead, however, he won't respawn. Monks are counted as teammates when capturing a control point."''
  :I want to know more about attack points.
  ::''"Attack points give your team a [[Battle Cry|battle cry]]; players within range receive a speed booost, attack speed [[buff]], and faster skill recharge for 60 seconds. The battle cry will be applied as long as you are in the area. Two NPC Rangers will spawn to assist you in maintaining control. Much like a player, the Rangers contribute to your team's capturing power. Conversely, once the Rangers die, they will not respawn until the next point switch."''
  :I'd like to learn about defense points.
  ::''"Defensive points give your team a [[Shielding Urn]]; players within the radius of the dropped urn share [[damage reduction]]. As long as you control this point, a new urn will spawn 30 seconds after the current one is used. An NPC Ritualist will spawn to assist you in maintaining control. Much like a player, the Ritualist contributes to your team's capturing power, but his spirits will not. Conversely, if the Ritualist dies, he will not respawn until the next point switch. If you lose control of a defensive point, your Shielding Urn will disappear."''
  :Tell me about the dragon roost.
  ::''"The dragon roost will spawn a [[Saltspray Dragon Hatchling|Saltspray Hatchling]]{{sic}} that can be used as a follower. The hatchling contributes to capturing and holding a control point similar to a human player. The hatchling respawns 60 seconds after it dies. If you lose control of the dragon roost, your Saltspray Hatchling{{sic}} dies."''

  The [[Rollerbeetle Race (Arena)|Rollerbeetle Race]] is a mini-game that first appeared during the [[Canthan New Year]] [[Special event|event]] as an addition to the [[Shing Jea Boardwalk]].\n\n\
  == Introduction ==\n\
  [[Image:Rollerbeetle Racer.jpg|thumb|Rollerbeetle Racer disguise]]\n\
  The player is transformed into a Rollerbeetle and must race other players to win [[Gamer point]]s and [[Victory Token]]s.\n\n\
  Races run as long as the boardwalk is open. Players who score within the top 100 will receive a special prize at the end of the festival (one prize per account).\n\n\
  These races do not cost anything to enter.\n\n\
  == How to play ==\n\
  Six players compete against each other in a race to the finish line. Each player automatically receives three core skills which become avaliable when the gates open and when they travel through each of the checkpoints. The other five skills can be charged only by hitting a [[Power Up Box]], when a power up box is hit a random one of the 5 will be charged.\n\n\
  === Skills ===\n\

  # Rollerbeetle Echo: Echo skill, similar to [[Echo]].\n\
  # Rollerbeetle Blast: Knock down opponent. \n\
  # Super Rollerbeetle: Extreme speedboost and defense against knockdown.  \n\
  : ''Note: '''Bolded''' skills are core skills which are recharged by reaching each of the 7 checkpoints.\n\n\
  === Checkpoints ===\n\
  There are six checkpoints spread through the racetrack. These checkpoints recharge your three core skills. If you are approaching a checkpoint and still have these stills active, it is recommended that you use it just before you travel through the checkpoint.\n\n\
  {{bug|Scoreboard lists the top three in the wrong order at Checkpoint 2 and the bridges after Checkpoint 5.}}\n\n\
  === Enviromental Effects ===\n\
  * Hills and slow inclines reduce your speed to a crawl (about 10%)\n\
  * Water reduces speed by 50%\n\n\
  === Finishing the race ===\n\
  Once a player has crossed the finish line, all of the other players have 30 seconds to finish the race or they don't win anything.\n\n\
  * First Place\n\
  ** 7 [[Victory Token]]s and 7 Gamer Points\n\
  ** 50 [[Balthazar Faction]] for winning\n\

  * Fourth Place: 2 Victory Tokens and 5 Gamer Points\n\
  * Fifth and Sixth Place: Recieve 1 Victory Token and 1 Gamer Point if they cross the finish line.\n\n\
  == Notes ==\n\
  * Players start out with 600,000 points and lose 1,000 for each second that has elapsed\n\
  * Players who die during the race are returned to the [[Rollerbeetle Racing (outpost)]]\n\
  * Previously the reward for winning was [[Lunar Token]]s instead of [[Victory Token]]s\n\n\

Hydra (Ascalon): |-
  __NOTOC__{{NPC infobox | species = Hydra
  | profession = e
  | level = 10
  | campaign = Prophecies
  }}
  
  '''Hydra''' are three-headed dinosaur-like creatures.  
  
  == Description ==
  Ascalon Hydra are found in pairs or small groups of up to four throughout the northwest territories of [[Post-Searing]] Ascalon.  They tend to mingle with other indigenous enemies in these areas, and so are commonly encountered with [[Stone Fury|Stone Furies]] and [[Boulder Elemental]]s in the Ascalon Foothills, for example, and with [[Charr]] hunting bands in the Flame Temple Corridor.  In the northern region of Dragon's Gullet, sets of Hydra groups flock together in herds and form lethal mobs when attacked.
  
  ==Locations==

  **[[Ascalon Foothills]]
  **[[Diessa Lowlands]]
  **[[Dragon's Gullet]]
  **[[Flame Temple Corridor]]
  
  ==Skills==
  *{{skill icon|Meteor}}
  *{{skill icon|Inferno}}
  
  ==Items dropped==
  *[[Leathery Claw]]
  
  == Notes ==
  
  Ascalon Hydra cast area of effect fire spells when players enter their [[aggro]] range: a party can expect either [[Fireball]] or [[Meteor]] spells (50% chance each) to be an immediate response to an attacking charge.  These spells can cause especially great injury to a party of [[henchmen]], which will tend to cluster around lead players.  Parties made up of grouped players may wish to consider spreading apart to avoid presenting dense clumped targets to the beasts.
  
  If Meteor is cast, characters will be knocked down and interrupted early in the battle.  Hydra are extremely fast, so it is not useful to flee when they are aroused.  They may also sprint through gaps in the battle line to attack rear-rank characters.  Where possible, it is best to separate small groups of Hydra from any other groups which may be in the area, and to fight them in controlled conditions.

  ===Reward===
  {{Mission reward
  | objective = Time taken (minutes)
  | standard = > 20
  | expert = < 20

  ==Walkthrough==
  For this mission you follow the spiraling downwards route to the heart of the jade whirlpool to confront Kuunavang.  Your path is blocked by not only Afflicted but a number of gates powered by Kuunavang which you open by damaging Kuunavang sufficiently.
  
  Kuunavang is a flying creature and stays well out of melee range for the early part of the mission, so it pays not to take a melee heavy team.  It also uses [[Corrupted Dragon Scales]], which inflicts crippling health degeneration on anyone in the area, and [[Dark Chain Lightning]], which inflicts damage high enough to take out a character with some death penalty in one swipe.  [[Corrupted Dragon Scales]] should be interrupted if possible, but it cannot be interrupted reliably so will take several attempts to do so.
  
  There are three gates.  Take out the Afflicted up to the gate and at each gate as priority. But try to stay spread out or out of Kuunavang's spell range to minimise damage from the lightning from Kuunavang.  Take care with the [[Afflicted Soul Explosion]].  Damage Kuunavang to bring down the barrier each time after you've dealt with the Afflicted.  After a barrier comes down you have access to a [[Resurrection Orb]] which can be used to resurrect members of the other team fighting along side you in the mission.
  
  After the third gate comes down if you avoid advancing to far down into the whirlpool it is possible to stop the final Afflicted groups from spawning.  Wait near the gate for Kuunavang to fly up, or back if it flies away. When you have damaged and almost defeated Kuunavang for the fourth time you are transported after a cut scene to the final face to face showdown.  Lay down damage, stay spread out and try to interrupt Corrupted Dragon Scales until you defeat Kunnavang to complete the mission.
  
  ===Skill recommendations===
  *Ranged damage is extremely important to be successful in this mission
  *Interrupts to try and stop Corrupted Dragon Scales
  *Armour ignoring damage is pretty effective
  *Ritualist spirits such as [[Shelter]] or [[Life]] effect both teams so are very useful in this mission.

  ==Notes==
  *The path shown on the map does indeed lead one to the '''Bringer of Deceit''', but the bridge is near-impossible to cross with any kind of party due to the 3 closely gathered groups of [[Margonite]]s and [[Torment creature]]s on the other side. An alternative would be to take a right turn in front of the bridge and follow the path from there on (staying near the west edge of the path) until one goes around to cross a black bridge that leads directly to the boss. There are small mobs along the way, but this should be remedied with a decent party. This is a longer, but safer way to approach the boss without having to suffer any sort of death penalty.

  The Door of Komalie is nearby. Push your way through the Mursaat and break the seals to open it.
  
  ==Objectives==
  Open the Door of Komalie.
  *Disable the seals to power down the Onyx Gate. 
  *Climb the path into Abaddon's Mouth. 
  *Break the magical seals holding closed the Door of Komalie. 
  *'''Bonus''' Free the Ghost of Leah Stone and then escort her to an island that she wants to reside in. 
  
  ==Skill recommendations==
  *The primary portion of the mission will put you against groups of [[Mursaat]] and [[Jade construct|Jade]]. Use skills sets similar to those from the previous mission to handle them. 
  *You will be confronted by every Mursaat boss at some point in the mission. If your party had a difficult time fighting [[Willa the Unpleasant]] and you don't want to run by her (a possibility if doing the bonus), be set to interrupt or otherwise disable or mitigate her healing.
  *The beginning gate is easier if a few party members are able to deal damage without visual contact with foes. Elementalist, Mesmer, and Necromancer spells that cause damage or health degeneration may be quite useful for this.
  
  ==Walkthrough==
  As the start of the mission, [[Vizier Khilbron]] appears and casts the enchantment [[Chimera of Intensity]] on the party. You will quickly come up to a gate, locked with an [[Ether Seal]]. With the gate closed, you can't physically reach the Mursaat behind the wall, but the same applies to them. It is usually a good idea to attempt to take out as many of the Mursaat along the wall as you can before opening the gate. Mursaat casters will still be able to cast some spells on the party, but it shouldn't be difficult for healers to keep the party healthy. This may take some time, but it is safer then rushing in and being attacked from both sides by both Mursaat and Jade.
  
  Once the gate is opened, you'll see a number of patrols around. Your current goal is to work your way towards the southwest where you will find two Ether Seals along the top of a gate with two Mursaat bosses down below by the door. Defeating these two Ether Seals by the bosses will open the door behind them. The easiest way to do so is to pull the groups of Jade away from anything else and defeat them. Then quickly move to the seal, defeat it, and run back. You should be able to take out everything around the bosses without the bosses joining in for more then a few seconds. While you aren't required to defeat the bosses, they will likely kill Leah if attempting the bonus and should be dispatched.
  
  Past the first door, the Vizier will appear again, casting Chimera of Intensity on the party. If you manage to kill the Mursaat Monk before it touches the Jade, the Jade will remain inactive and will not retaliate as you kill them. Continue west towards the next Ether Seal and a number of Jade guarding it. Opening this gate leads to a small open area with two more bosses and a number of Mursaat. Again, you do not need to defeat the bosses, but it is typically easier to kill them to give easier access to the seal behind them. It's easiest to lure them away from the rest of the Mursaat, especially the pesky Monk that likes to heal them, in order to defeat them. The Jade Bows by the seal can be dispatched with ease with the same tactics used at the beginning of the mission. Break the seal to proceed.
  
  After yet another seal and more Jade Bows, you'll come to a hill with a forked road going up to the last two Mursaat bosses and another seal. As before, lure them from the Seal, defeat them, break the seal, and move on. Cross the ethereal bridge to reach the seals that lock the Door of Komalie. The Vizier tells you that you must break all six seals.
  
  Each time you break a seal, a group of six low-level [[Seal Guard]]s appear and are easy to dispatch. However, every thirty seconds or so, [[Mursaat Guardian]]s will appear at both north and south of the seals and will proceed to engage the party. If left unattended, these guardians will become the biggest threat, so take them out as they spawn. Be patient with taking out the Ether Seals. Each seal will cause three sets of Mursaat Guardians to appear, so if you break the seals too quickly, you might find yourself overwhelmed by the Guardians.
  
  After the seals have been broken, the Vizier reveals his true form. You must defeat the [[Burning Titan]] that appears (although it won't attack you) to complete the mission.
  
  ===Bonus===
  Leah Stone's ghost is trapped along the docks of the fortress before the first Mursaat bosses behind a pair of Ether Seals. When you break the seals, Leah tells you she wishes you to escort her spirit to a green island to the west. She will then proceed to slowly walk around the fortress, eventually heading towards the door where the first Mursaat bosses wait. Since she is easily killed and will walk all around the fortress, clear out all the Jade and Mursaat in the fortress before freeing her. Some players will even wait until the entire path to the island is clear before freeing her.
  
  Past the door where the first bosses were you'll notice a lava lake probably surrounded by [[Mahgo Hydra]]s and [[Flesh Golem]]s. You will have to cross this lava lake, so it is easiest to lure the creatures away from the lava to fight them. Across the lake, proceed northwest following the path by the coast, taking out patrols as you go. You'll eventually see a lone green tree on an island. That is where Leah wants to be guided.
  
  When you step foot on the island, you'll confront an [[Eidolon]] and possibly [[Snyk the Hundred Tongue]]. Take them out and proceed towards the tree. You will be confronted by a pair of [[Wurm]]s who should also be taken out. The path should now be clear and safe for Leah to travel. If you haven't done so, break her free from behind the Ether Seal and wait for her to reach the island.

As before, if you bring him the [[Spectral Essence]] dropped from the [[Eidolon]], he will [[infuse]] the [[armor]] of players who talk with him. However, it is much easier to infuse armor in the [[Iron Mines of Moladune]].
  *The Jade and Mursaat bosses share 3 spawn points. 2 of the six boses will spawn at each point.
  *The Dryder bosses share 2 spawn points. 1 of the three bosses will spawn at each point, with 1 not spawning.

Gate of Madness: |-
  {{Location disambiguation|Gate of Madness}}{{Mission infobox
  | name = Gate of Madness
  | campaign = Nightfall
  | region = Realm of Torment
  | type = Cooperative
  | duration = Long
  | preceded by = [[All Alone in the Darkness]]
  | followed by = [[Abaddon's Gate (mission)|Abaddon's Gate]]}}
  '''Gate of Madness''' is considered to be one of the most difficult missions in [[Nightfall]].  It involves a reasonably long journey to the area where the shrines are, followed by a challenging battle with [[Lich Lord|The Lich]] and [[Shiro Tagachi]].  Come prepared for the final fight.
  
  Begin by initially following and then crossing a ravine.  You will reach a gate at which point Shiro will speak and summon [[Shiro'ken]] to fight.  Once these are defeated move through the gate.  Wait for the Lich to speak and for Torment Rifts to form and the enemies defending them to spawn.  Enemies will continue to spawn from the rifts while they are open and each must be closed before the way to shrines is opened.
  
  After closing the rifts move to the gate where the shrines are, Shiro and the Lich will attack.  Kill the Lich while ignoring Shiro, who is not dangerous unless he is taking damage which triggers his special skills.  It is recommended that the shrines for each of the gods be taken prior to attempting to kill Shiro as they give a large number of blessings.  Travel to each shrine in turn and take them while killing the Margonites defending so they do not take the shrine back while you fight Shiro.  Follow the tips below to defeat Shiro to complete the mission.
  
  ==Mission information==
  
  ===Objectives===
  * Travel to the Temple of the Six Gods.
  * Close the torment rifts by slaying the portal wraiths. 
  * Activate the shrines to the Five Gods to aid you in battle.
  * Destroy the [[Lich Lord]] and [[Shiro Tagachi]].
  * '''Bonus''' Rally the god avatars.
  
  ===Reward===
  The reward depends on the number of shrines to the five gods you have captured.
  {{Mission reward
  | objective = Shrines held
  | standard = 0 - 1
  | expert = 2 - 4
  | master = 5 }}
  
  ==Walkthrough==
  
  For this mission you are accompanied by [[Kormir]]. She does not take damage so you will not need to concern yourself with her presence.
  
  The first part of this mission is travelling to the Shrines.  Follow the left wall after entering the area and cross the ravine at the bridge.  You will encounter and need to kill groups of [[Realm of Torment]] Titans, Margonites and [[Torment Demon]]s.  Take care with patrols here as they do overlap and you only want to fight one group at a time.
  
  Once you've crossed the ravine you come across a gate (1) at which Shiro, antagonist from Factions, speaks and summons four groups of Shiro'ken to attack.  You can avoid two of these groups by pushing through the gate as it opens, and only attacking those Shiro'ken which spawn in your way.
  
  Once through the gate, the Lich, antagonist from Prophecies, speaks and five chaos rifts open and a number of enemies spawn, such as Margonites and the Prophecies variants of Titans. Don't be too quick about moving into this area (2) until the rifts have formed and the enemies have spawned. Each rift, like in Prophecies, is defended by three [[Portal Wraith]]s which must be defeated for the rift to close. Enemies, such as Margonites, appear from these portals and will continue to do so while the portal is open and you continue to kill them rather than the wraiths. Close all of the portals.  Take care of patrols, before aggroing the Portal Wraiths.  Eliminate the Wraiths before any enemies which might respawn from the portal.
  
  Once the portals are closed the gate to the shrine area opens.  In this area (3) the Lich and Shiro await so take time to recover before launching into this fight.  As you approach, the Lich and Shiro say suitably threatening words in your direction and attack.  
  
  This fight is really all about Shiro who can do huge amounts of damage while proving rather annoying to kill. The Lich isn't particularly scary or difficult to take down so take him down first before doing anything else in this area. You don't really need to be too concerned about Shiro as he doesn't hit too hard until you really start to attack him, so just try to stay out of his way.
  
  It is strongly recommended that you complete the bonus even if you aren't interested in the Master's reward for this mission. Each shrine you capture gives you a number of [[blessing]]s which will assist you in defeating Shiro. Read about the bonus below.
  
  Now defeat Shiro. Stay spread out, and if you can keep him on one target, possibly by stretching him to the extent of his aggro range, this can be beneficial. Use stance removing skills on [[Battle Scars]] as soon as he puts it up if you can. Once Shiro's health is low enough he starts to use [[Impossible Odds]] which can be devastating. Try to use covered anti-melee hexes and skills which cause block to mitigate the damage from this skill.
  
  ===Bonus===
  There are Five Shrines to the gods which you can capture in the area with Shiro and the Lich.  You capture these by having the greatest numbers at the base of the Shrine, capturing the point over time similar to [[Alliance Battle]]s.  Each Shrine is devoted to a particular god, and each is defended by two to four Margonites of that type so for example there are Mesmers at Lyssa's Shrine, Monks at Dwayna's.  
  
  The easiest way to do the bonus is to kill the Undead Lich first. Then travel between the shrines, avoiding Shiro while killing the Margonites at each Shrine and capture it. If you leave the Margonites at a shrine they will eventually return the shrine to neutral which could disadvantage you while you fight Shiro. You can get rid of Shiro easily by having the whole party run to the back wall of the shrine area, in which case he returns to the middle, making the killing of the Margonites easier.
  
  You will get the bonus if all five of the Shrines were captured at some point during the mission.
  
  If you are doing the bonus on hard mode, it is most important that you pull the Undead Lich without Shiro when trying to kill him. This is done by slowly moving along the right wall when entering the area where they reside.
  
  ===Pulling Shiro===
  
  The safest strategy of disposing Shiro is to pull him all the way towards the gate through which you entered the final area. Have your parties healers, casters and ranged attackers form a semi-circle around the gate, while one tank pulls Shiro. Shiro will follow you outside of the gate but then be stuck on the tank instead of going after your party's backline, like he would in the main area. Concentrate your healing on the tank and Shiro should go down easily. Be sure to pull Shiro up to the point where he does not follow you any longer to ensure he does break aggro. Should he decide to go after your backline none-the-less, pull back till he attacks the tank again.
  
  ===Skill Recommendations===
  * [[Lightbringer's Gaze]] for the [[Torment creature]]s and [[Titan]]s.
  * Stance breaking skills such as [[Wild Blow]] or [[Wild Throw]] to end [[Battle Scars]].
  * Mesmer or Necromancer anti-Melee hexes such as [[Empathy]], [[Price of Failure]], [[Insidious Parasite]], [[Spiteful Spirit]] and [[Spoil Victor]] for [[Shiro]].
  * Interrupts against the [[Undead Lich]].
  * Consider bringing skills which block attacks.

  The [[Dragon Arena]] is a PvP arena set in a modified version of the [[Imperial Isle]] guild hall that is accessible only during [[Shing Jea Boardwalk]] [[Special event|events]] by talking to [[Captain Li Sah]]. During the [[Second Birthday Celebration]], the Dragon Arena was accessable from the [[Great Temple of Balthazar]], opening the arena to all campaigns.
  
  == Introduction ==
  
  The game format resembles [[w:Dodgeball|dodgeball]] as all players, regardless of profession, are equipped with a skillset that allows them to throw a "ball" and run quickly to [[dodge (action)|dodge]] their opponents' balls. All life and armor is also standardized through the [[environment effect]] [[Spirit of the Festival]], and dead players are resurrected at a shrine every 30 seconds. Teams consist of 6 randomly chosen players, and to win a team must accumulate 20 kills before its opponent. In case of a tie, both teams lose.
  
  '''Note:''' Dying while competing in the Dragon Arena will ''not'' be counted against players who are progressing towards a [[Survivor]] [[Title]], however no [[experience]] points are gained either.
  
  == Skills ==
  {{skill bar|Dragon Blast|Imperial Majesty|Trade Winds|Resurrection Signet|Resurrection Signet|Resurrection Signet|Resurrection Signet|Resurrection Signet}}
  
  Dragon Blast: Skill. Send a projectile that will kill target foe if it hits.
  
  Imperial Majesty: Target touched foe kowtows before you and is dealed 80 dmg.
  
  Trade Winds: for 10 seconds, move with the swiftness of the Canthan fleet.
  
  == Rewards ==
  Each team member receives:
  * 40 [[Faction Points (Balthazar)| Balthazar Faction]] for unique opponent deaths. 
  * 3 [[Victory_Token|Victory Tokens]], 50 faction, and 5 [[Gamer]] points for team wins. 
  * 50 faction for five consecutive wins. 
  ''Note: Players do not accumulate [[Gladiator]] points for 10 consecutive wins.''
  
  == Tips ==
  *Keep Trade Winds up at all times to maximize dodging ability. Cast it just before encountering opponents and retreat from nearby opponents before the effect wears off. If it isn't possible to retreat far enough to recast, attempt to time activation just after dodging Dragon Blasts. When dead continually click Trade Winds so that when you are resurrected (either by a player or shrine) you will immediately have it on you, rather than waiting for visual confirmation that you are alive again (standing up animation).
  *Use "click-to-move." Using your mouse to move instead of your keyboard will ensure you run at maximum speed whatever direction you may be running.
  *Against players who tend to shoot at maximum range, dodge first before returning fire. Be aware of the position of other enemy players as it is often necessary to dodge multiple times before returning fire. It can be useful to [[kite]] your opponents closer to your teammates for aid.
  *Watch for players using Imperial Majesty, as they can't control their movement and are therefore easy to kill.
  *Against players who are adept at dodging, it is necessary to use Dragon Blast at closer range to minimize flight time of the ball. Imperial Majesty is very effective to close in on a target. Once you are at at about half of the max range, use Dragon Blast to make dodging extremely difficult.
  *At very close range, use Imperial Majesty to [[knock down]] your opponent before he can use Dragon Blast. Another use for this skill is as a delaying mechanism. If you have already used your Dragon Blast, Imperial Majesty could give your teammate the time to make the kill or allow you to make a getaway.
  *It is inadvisable to resurrect teammates whose bodies are near opponents. Resurrections occur every 30 seconds anyways and you will be very vulnerable while resurrecting. Once resurrected, your teammate will also be very vulnerable because he will not have Trade Winds on him.
  *Hitting the Esc button will cancel skill activation. It is often beneficial to cancel your Dragon Blast or Trade Winds mid-activation and dodge if you observe your target (or his teammate) activating a Dragon Blast aimed at you at the same time.
  *Keep track of your position in relation to your teammates and attack your opponents from opposite sides when possible. It is much more difficult dodge attacks coming from two sides than one.
  *Go for the easy kill first. Skill level will vary widely among your opponents. If you encounter an adept dodger early, it may be beneficial to disengage from him and focus on another (hopefully easier) target. Once his teammates have been eliminated, you can press your numerical advantage against the highly skilled player.
  *Resurrected opponents are invulnerable for several seconds. Do not [[camping|camp]] too close to the shrine expecting to score an easy kill.
  *Pillars and walls obstruct Dragon Blasts, but note that a pillar or other barrier will not block a Dragon Blast that has been cast before you broke line-of-sight. [[Camper]]s hide behind pillars and use Dragon Blast to kill anyone attempting to kill them while they are obstructed by the pillar.
  *Campers behind the pillars supporting the "bases" are easy to kill if you walk to the opposite side of the pillar, then use Imperial Majesty.
  
  == Trivia ==
  *This game is sometimes referred to as [[w:Dragon_Ball|dragon ball]] in a play on words.
  *Originally this game was played in Guild vs Guild matches (scrimmages later). Both sides played Me/E 105hp fastcasters and used:
  **[[Fast Casting]]: 12+3+1 
  **[[Air Magic]]: 12

  Born in [[Serenity Temple]] to a priest of [[Dwayna]] and priestess of [[Balthazar]], [[Mhenlo]] has been steeped in the teachings of healing and smiting magic. A devoted servant of both Dwayna and Balthazar, he has studied hard his entire life, and has been rewarded by both the gods of his provenance. But paying allegiance to two gods has not been without its consequences; having no clear path to follow, Mhenlo has a tendency to overanalyze situations and possible consequences, not sure whether to take the path of aggressive strength or that of defensive grace. \n\n\
  Mhenlo spent much of his life inside Serenity Temple, paying homage to the old gods and studying the Path, which will lead him to enlightenment. He also spent a long stretch of his youth studying under [[Master Togo]] of [[Shing Jea Monastery]], where he was exposed to even more religious and philosophical teachings that made it no easier for the young [[monk]] to find a focus in life. But the teachings of Togo and the [[Ritualist]]\xE2\x80\x99s wisdom made a deep impact on Mhenlo. When Master Togo sends a request for Mhenlo\xE2\x80\x99s aid, the monk wastes no time gathering his friends and setting out for [[Cantha]].He is one of the [[Heroes of Ascalon]]\n\n\

  ''And prayed Jadoth, "Abaddon! Lord of the Everlasting Depths, Keeper of Secrets, open mine eyes and bestow upon me the knowledge of the Abyss that I might smite mine enemies and send them to the watery depths!''
  
  ''An unsettling silence swept across the waves. The twilight sky shattered and stars streaked down upon the Forgotten armada. The seas boiled and ruptured, and gave birth to a maelstrom from which not even light could escape, and transforming the sky above into a midnight void.''
  
  ''And thus was magic gifted to Jadoth, chosen of Abaddon, the first of the [[Margonite]]s.''
  
  ''-- Scriptures of Abaddon, 1BE''

  ===Storyline===
  The corporeal form of Abaddon is encountered in the [[Abaddon's Gate (mission)]], the final [[mission]] of the Nightfall storyline. His form is defeated by the players, and [[Kormir]] sacrifices herself to seal his godly powers and become the new [[Goddess of Truth]].

  ==Notes==
  *Although he shares many traits with [[boss]]es and meets the common definition of a [[Wikipedia:boss (video games)|video game boss]], Abaddon is technically not a boss.
  
  ==Trivia==
  *The name "Abaddon" is the English form of the word "Avadon" in Hebrew which translates to "doom" or "hell".
  *For more information on the name Abaddon see the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abaddon Wikipedia article on Abaddon]
  *If your party uses the [[Dance|/dance]] [[emote]] before engaging Abaddon he will perform some dance moves before slaying your entire party with the message "You got served!". The video can be seen [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jozvyKAKgfQ here]. Every human party member must use the dance emote for this to work. The emote /dancenew does not trigger the effect.

  [[Image:Danika zu Heltzer.jpg|150px|thumb]]\n\
  '''Danika zu Heltzer''' dwells with the rest of her family in the fortress-like [[Cathedral zu Heltzer]], a monument to [[Saint Viktor]] (one of the two champions who slew [[Shiro Tagachi]] on the [[day of the Jade Wind]]). Like her father [[Count Petrov zu Heltzer]], leader of the great [[Kurzick]] House that bears their last name, Danika is proud to name the venerable Viktor as an ancestor. Unlike her father, Danika is much more open-minded toward non- Kurzicks and the other Kurzick Houses. This is probably attributable to her avid reading habits. To overcome the extreme boredom of what she considers her \xE2\x80\x9Cimprisonment\xE2\x80\x9D in the cathedral, she has voraciously devoured the contents of countless tomes in the zu Heltzer family library, especially those that speak of other lands and other peoples. \n\n\
  Danika has never been more frustrated with the Kurzicks\xE2\x80\x99 isolationist policies, which she believes can only lead to the further decline of her people, and indeed her world. She is eager to venture into the world outside [[Echovald Forest]], and find new allies for all the Kurzicks. Like [[Argo]], her sense of justice is strong, and she would be among the first of the Kurzicks to set aside factional differences should a greater threat arise. She has even had some contact, against her father\xE2\x80\x99s strict orders, with [[Vasburg Armory|House Vasburg]], the longtime rivals of [[House zu Heltzer]].\n\n\

  [[Dunkoro]] is one of the [[hero]]es available in [[Guild Wars Nightfall]]. An older advisor within the [[Order of the Sunspears]], Dunkoro is the man with the plan.\n\n\
  From the [http://www.guildwars.com/theworld/heroes/ official website]:\n\

  ::''\"The outcome of a battle is determined before the first soldier leaves the barracks.\"''\n\n\
  :'''Origin:''' [[Istan]]\n\
  :'''Age:''' 48\n\
  :'''Profession:''' [[Monk]]\n\n\
  :''A lifetime of experience has made Dunkoro the man he is today: a master strategist who knows his way around [[Elona]]. He's a veteran of countless battles against [[corsair|pirates]], [[centaur]]s, desert raiders, Thumpers, and stranger enemies. With that wisdom has come a realization that he's not the best soldier to lead a charge; instead, he prefers to advise those who do. Not everyone accepts his advice, though. Some claim that he's become too careful with old age, that he's lost the edge that makes him a deadly soldier. Time will tell. For any hero who would hesitate before rushing into battle, Dunkoro would be a valuable ally. If you're willing to listen, he's the man with a plan.''\n\n\
  From the manual:\n\
  :''A lifetime of experience has made Dunkoro the man he is today: an elder strategist who knows his way around Elona. He's a veteran of battles against [[corsair]]s, [[Centaur]]s, [[heket]], desert raiders, and stranger enemies. Although he's faced countless dangers alone, he prefers to spend his time advising other soldiers, offering direction and insight to any soldier who will listen. Unfortunately, not everyone listens to his advice. Most recruits respect him professionally, but personally, he remains distant from everyone below him in rank. When life and death are on the line, he doesn't seem to care about other people's fears and concerns, only results: you win, or you die. With this determined and unemotional approach to warfare, Dunkoro's insights have meant the difference between victory and defeat throughout his career. For any hero who prefers rational strategy over chaos, Dunkoro is the man with a plan.''\n\n\

The headpiece provides +1 in the attribute of the rune applied to it. His [[armor rating]] ranges from 3 to 60, depending on his level.\n\n\
  The appearance of his armor can be upgraded to [[Elite Sunspear Armor]] using [[Stolen Sunspear Armor]] acquired from the [[Dajkah Inlet]] [[Challenge Mission]]. The appearance of his armor can be upgraded to [[Primeval armor]] using [[Primeval Armor Remnants]] acquired in the [[Domain of Anguish]] and during [[the Ebony Citadel of Mallyx]] mission.\n\n\
  ==Dialogue==\n\
  :''\"You can't just run off without a plan. Let me help you. I've been with the [[Sunspears]] for years. I plan out strategies. [[Kormir]] executes them. Let me do the same for you.\"''\n\n\
  ==Notes==\n\
  *A duplicate Dunkoro will show up as a \"Sunspear Monk\".\n\n\

  '''In [[Grenz Frontier (Kurzick)]]''':
  :''"We're lucky you arrived, fellow Kurzick. As you can see, we are in a bit of trouble. The Luxon have pushed past our outer defenses. With your help, I'm certain we can drive out those nasty Luxons."''
  :''"What do you need to know?"''
  '''In [[Etnaran Keys (Kurzick)]]''':
  :''"Welcome to the front. We have pushed into Luxons{{sic}} territory and are gaining ground. Now get out there and teach those dirty Luxons a lesson!"''
  '''Conversation options''':
  :Give me a brief summary of the objectives
  ::''"The goal here is to amass 500 points before the other team."''
  ::''"You gain points by killing opposing players and maintaining possession over [[control point]]s, of which there are 7 in total. Of the 7 total control points, there are 6 dfferent types: 1 resurrection shrine, 1 resurrection orb, 1 melee defense point, 1 elemental defense point, 1 attack point, and 2 NPC follower points."''
  :Explain how to capture key points.
  ::''"A control point is captured when your team outnumbers the enemy players within range of the contested location."''
  ::''"While capturing, there are 4 rates of change: 1 additional player (approximately 20 seconds to change the paint state), 3 additional players (approximately 11 seconds to change the point state), and 4 or more additional players (approximately 8 seconds to change the point stage)."''
  ::''"As long as your aggro circle overlaps the control point, you are counted as a catpuring team member."''
  ::''"Capture points have 3 states: enemy control, neutral control, and friendly control."''
  ::''"Finally, pets, minions, Spirits and so on are excluded from capturing control points."''
  :Inform me about the [[resurrection shrine]]s.
  ::''"Resurrection shrines allow you to revive closer tothe battlefield. Catpure of a shrine will spawn an NPC Monk to help maintain control. Once the monk is dead, however, he won't respawn. Monks are counted as teammates when capturing a control point."''
  :I want to know more about attack points.
  ::''"Attack points give your team a [[Battle Cry|battle cry]]; players within range receive a speed booost, attack speed [[buff]], and faster skill recharge for 60 seconds. The battle cry will be applied as long as you are in the area. Two NPC Rangers will spawn to assist you in maintaining control. Much like a player, the Rangers contribute to your team's capturing power. Conversely, once the Rangers die, they will not respawn until the next point switch."''
  :I'd like to learn about melee defense points.
  ::''"Melee defenes points provide players within range with an increased chance to evade melee attacks."''
  :I'd like to learn about elemental defense points.
  ::''"Elemental defense points provide players within range with increased elemental armor."''
  :Tell me about followers.
  ::''"The Elite Elementalist point and Elite Warrior Point spawn a follower Elementalist and Warrior, respectively. The followers contribute to capturing and holding control points the same as a human player. Followers respawn 60 seconds after they die, thoough if you lose control of your point, your follower automatically dies."''
  :Tell me about [[resurrection orb]]s.
  ::''"Resurrection orb shrines give your team a resurrection orb; fallen players within the radius of the dropped orb are resurrected. The orb respawns 30 seconds after it has been dropped. This point, much like a resurrection shrine, spawns an NPC Monk to asssist you in maintaining control."''
  :I'll be on my way.

  The [[demon]] of [[nightmare]]s is one tough customer, capable of inflicting a staggering amount of melee damage and keeping his [[Health]] bar full with a powerful healing ability called [[Nightmare Refuge]]. Heroes will only be able to inflict so much harm on '''Kanaxai''' unless he is knocked down. Once down, he can be harmed again, but he will get back up as soon as possible. Once his health reaches the next predetermined amount, you will have to knock him down once more before he will take any more.
  
  To kill Kanaxai, your party will have to knock him down a total of 10 times. As if that wasn't difficult enough, every time you knock him down, he will spawn between 6 and 10 nightmare creatures that you must eliminate...and while you're dealing with them, Kanaxai will have the chance to use his powerful healing abilities once more. Careful coordination of your team's attack will be critical to taking the demon of nightmares down for good.

  Adian suspects the plants in the area are being warped as a side effect of experiments being being conducted in the wizard's tower.  Go collect a root sample for him.\n\n\
  ==Quest information==\n\
  ===Requirements===\n\
  * [[Ranger]] [[profession]]\n\n\
  ===Objectives===\n\
  * Go to the falls to the west. Destroy the aloe husks until you find an aloe root.\n\

  * {{skill icon|Ignite Arrows}}\n\
  * {{skill icon|Dual Shot}}\n\n\
  ==Walkthrough==\n\
  Equipping the two skills Adian gives you will be a big help, as the [[Large Aloe Seed]]s you will encounter are susceptible to [[fire damage]] and come in clusters of three.  This quest serves as an introduction to the concept of [[skill chaining]], using skills in combination for greater effect.  Using [[Dual Shot]] doubles the effect of [[Ignite Arrows]].\n\n\
  Follow the quest marker east until you encounter the river.  Several Large Aloe Seeds will be hanging out here.  Kill them, using your new skills if you  wish.  They will drop [[Aloe Root]]s when they die.  Pick one up and take it back to Adian.\n\n\

  ===Initial dialogue===\n\
  '''Aidan'''\n\
  :''\"Ever since Aziure started her work at the wizard tower, this region has been plagued by unnatural plant-like creatures. I suspect her magical experiments have inadvertently warped the local flora to create these '''aloe husks'''.\"''\n\
  :''\"Groundless accusations, however, are not a reasonable way to resolve a problem. I'd like you to hunt these monsters for a while and see if you can find an '''aloe root''', so that I might examine it more closely and see if my suspicions are correct.\"''\n\
  :''\"Explore near the falls in the west to look for the creatures. I can provide you, temporarily, with a few skills that should make the task easier.\"''\n\n\

  ===Reward dialogue===\n\
  '''Aidan'''\n\

  ==Mission information==
  
  ===Requirements===
  Finishing steps 1-6 of the quest [[Mallyx the Unyielding (quest)|Mallyx the Unyielding]] is a requirement to start the mission. The finishing of this mission is also the last step of this quest. To start the mission, speak with [[High Priest Zhellix]]. If the party has someone who has not fulfilled the requirements of the mission, the priest will not start the mission, and will point out who of the group is not qualified for the mission.
  
  ===Objectives===
  * Protect [[High Priest Zhellix]] while he performs the opening ritual on the Ebony Citadel.
  * Defeat [[Mallyx the Unyielding]].
  
  ===Reward===
  * Chance of receiving [[Primeval Armor Remnants]] for party members
  * [[Citadel Chest]] which gives one of [[Mallyx the Unyielding#Items dropped|Mallyx's unique items]] to each party member
  * Completion of [[Mallyx the Unyielding (quest)|Mallyx the Unyielding]] quest and taking it's reward.
  
  ==Walkthrough==
  ===Defending Zhellix===
  The first step of the mission is to protect Zhellix while he performs the opening ritual. Nineteen (19) groups of monsters either spawn or arrive at the area of the priest: 
  *[[Margonite]]s
  *[[Titan]]s
  *[[Torment creature]]s
  *[[Stygian Veil]] creatures.
  
  The waves come in the following order (pay close attention to when each group spawns as some groups will spawn on the death of certain foes and not others):
  #From the south and west: 1 [[Margonite Anur Ki]], 1 [[Margonite Anur Su]], 1 [[Margonite Anur Kaya]], 1 [[Margonite Anur Tuk]], 1 [[Margonite Anur Vu]] and 1 [[Margonite Anur Rund]].
  #From the east: Shortly after (and regardless of whether any were killed) 1 [[Misery Titan]], 2 [[Fury Titan]]s, 1 [[Tortureweb Dryder]] and 1 [[Greater Dream Rider]].
  #From the west: As soon as all original members of group 2 die (Titan spawns do not count, group 1 does not matter). 2 [[Anguish Titan]]s and 1 Tortureweb Dryder.
  #From the west: As soon as original members of group 3 die. 1 [[Heart Tormentor]], 1 [[Mind Tormentor]], 1 [[Water Tormentor]], 1 [[Soul Tormentor]] and 1 [[Flesh Tormentor]]
  #From the south: As soon as original members of group 4 die (spawns from [[Call to the Torment]] do not count). 1 Mind Tormentor, 1 [[Earth Tormentor]], 1 Flesh Tormentor, 1 [[Sanity Tormentor]] and 1 [[Spirit Tormentor]]
  #Center (just south of priest): As soon as original members of group 5 die. 1 [[Stygian Fiend]], 1 [[Stygian Brute]], 1 [[Stygian Horror]], 1 [[Stygian Hunger]], 1 [[Stygian Golem]]
  #Center (just south of priest): As soon as group 6 dies. 1 [[Stygian Fiend]], 1 [[Stygian Brute]], 1 [[Stygian Golem]], 1 [[Stygian Hunger]], 1 [[Stygian Golem]]
  #From the south: As soon as group 7 dies. 5 Greater Dream Riders.
  #From the west: As soon as group 7 dies (they spawn at the same time as group 8). 2 Tortureweb Dryders, 1 [[Rage Titan]], 1 [[Despair Titan]].
  #From the south: As soon as group 8 dies (even if group 9 did not). 1 Heart Tormentor, 1 Soul Tormentor, 1 Margonite Anur Vu, 1 Margonite Anur Tuk, 1 Flesh Tormentor
  #Center: As soon as group 10 dies. 1 Heart Tormentor, 1 Water Tormentor, 1 Stygian Horror, 1 Stygian Brute, 1 Stygian Golem
  #Center (just south of priest): As soon as group 11 dies. 6 [[Dementia Titan]]s.
  #From the east: As soon as group 12 dies. 2 Misery Titans, 2 Anguish Titans.
  #From the South: As soon as original members of group 13 die. 1 Margonite Anur Ki, 1 Margonite Anur Ruk, 1 Margonite Anur Su, 1 Margonite Anur Tuk, 1 Margonite Anur Vu
  #Center (slightly west): As soon as group 14 dies. 2 Rage Titans, 2 Despair Titans, 2 Dementia Titans (these Titans do NOT spawn other Titans).
  #Center (slightly east): As soon as group 15 dies. 5 Stygian Fiends.
  #From the west: As soon as group 16 dies. 1 Heart Tormentor, 1 Mind Tormentor, 1 Flesh Tormentor, 1 Water Tormentor, 1 Soul Tormentor.
  # and 19, final mobs after group 17 dies: From the east: Misery Titan, Greater Dream Rider, Tortureweb Dryder, Heart Tormentor, Water Tormentor and Spirit Tormentor. From the south: Margonite Anur Ki, Margonite anur Ruk, Margonite Anur Rund, Margonite Anur Su, Margonite Anur Tuk and Margonite Anur Vu.
  
  After the original members of groups 18 and 19 are killed, the door to Mallyx's citadel opens and the priest will be removed from the party list, where he was listed as an ally. As soon as any party member steps past the door, a short cut-scene is played, the whole party is transferred inside the Citadel and the door is closed behind them. 
  
  Mallyx will be standing on a pedestal and will not be hostile, as will be four spirits. As soon as ''any'' party member comes close enough to Mallyx (about 1.5 times the [[aggro]] radius), Mallyx will give a short speech then turn hostile and attack.
  
  '''Moving the Priest:'''
  
  A technique that makes fending off the groups much easier is to pull the priest away from the spot where he is performing the ritual (which is the end point for all incoming waves). This can be achieved by having the priest chase a foe down to the gate of the citadel, and then killing that foe. The priest will remain in that spot and will not try to return to his original spot. 
  
  The best candidate for this action is one of the two Fury Titans that come as part of group 2. Since they are original members of the group, the following spawns will not trigger until they die. And because they are the smallest titans, they will not spawn any more after their death. Therefore, the party should leave one Fury Titan alive, bring him close to the priest so that the priest starts attacking him and then have his target slowly back up all the way to the Citadel door and wait for the priest to catch up. If done correctly, protecting the priest will not be a factor in defeating these monsters.
  
  '''Fighting away from the priest:'''
  Another tactic to facilitate defending the priest is, once the priest is moved, to actually pull groups up the hill (towards the southwest) and use the big rock at that spot for tanking and nuking. The one draw back of this approach is that there are two groups (group 9 and 17) that spawn at that position. However, the benefit (which strongly outweighs the disadvantage) is that the party can retreat at any time and disengage whenever they feel overwhelmed.
  
  ===Defeating Mallyx===
  Four "Soul" [[spirit]]s reside behind Mallyx which are responsible for the 4 [[environmental effect]]s in the room, known from the four sections of the [[Gate of Anguish (Explorable)|Gate of Anguish]] explorable area:
  #[[Repressive Energy]]: lose 2 energy for each [[attack]] or use of a [[skill]]
  #[[Enduring Torment]]: lose 10 health for every second of [[movement]]
  #[[Shroud of Darkness]]: all [[attack]]s have a 50% chance to [[miss]]
  #[[Demonic Miasma]]: take 50 damage for every [[block]], or [[dodge]]
  
  Killing each spirit removes the respective environmental effect. When taking out the spirits the following tactics are useful:
  *Skills that do bonus damage to spirits such as [[Unnatural Signet]] and [[Spiritual Pain]].
  *[[Ritualist]] skills that destory spirits such as [[Gaze of Fury]], [[Signet of Creation]] and [[Consume Soul]].
  
  [[Mallyx the Unyielding|Mallyx]] himself uses a few particularly nasty [[monster skill]]s, spoiling the "classic" party setup with tanks in the frontline and ranged attackers, spellcasters and healers in the backline: 
  #[[Summoning Shadows]] is used to bring all foes to him.
  #[[Shadow Smash]] is used to deal massive damage to any foes near to him, and (if they survived the smash) to move them ''away'' from him. If this happens, party members need to kite to re-establish aggro on the desired party tank.
  #[[Consume Torment]] purges all hexes and conditions and converts them into a strong source of healing. This skill can be [[Diversion|Diverted]] however. In fact, as Diversion is, itself, a hex, it will cause him to try and use this skill and lose it for a significant amount of time. 
  #[[Banish Enchantment]] strips all [[enchantment]]s from a foe and on top of that disables one skill for every party member for every enchantment removed. Unless this skill itself is disabled, enchantment use against Mallyx is discouraged.
  #[[Wild Smash]] ends [[stance]]s and disables them.
  
  Because of these skills, the party should try and use bonuses that cannot be removed or exploited, such as [[Spirit]] effects, [[Weapon Spell]]s, [[Ward]]s, [[Well]]s, [[Shout]]s, etc., or plain [[skill]]s.
  
  If Mallyx isn't hard enough to beat, groups of demons spawn as reinforcement when Mallyx's health drops below certain thresholds:
  * at 80% 2 groups of random "Anur" [[Margonite]]s (two per group) will spawn from portals on either side of the door.
  * at 50% 2 groups comprised of 2 random [[Torment Demon]]s creatures each.
  
  Tips on fighting Mallyx:
  
  *Mallyx has heavy armor (80 AL), and can shrug off ordinarily devastating blows with ease.  Because of this, [[Air Magic]] spells and other armor-penetrating skills are particularly effective against him (Air spells do 100% damage against him).  Even more effective are spells that ignore armor entirely as are some elementalist skills such as [[Obsidian Flame]] and necromancer skills like [[Shadow Strike]].
  *[[Ritualist]]s are perhaps the best class built to deal with Mallyx, as they do not rely on enchantments.  He has no way to deal with [[Spirit]]s or [[Weapon Spell]]s, making these useful for defeating him. [[Displacement]] and [[Shelter]] are very potent in containing Mallyx on his own.
  *Disabling Mallyx's skills with skills like [[Blackout]].
  
  ===Alternate Method===
  The most common method to defeating Mallyx presently is to ''avoid'' fighting him altogether. This method relies on using party members who do straight damage (no conditions or hexes) and utilizes a corpse outside the gate to teleport one party member outside once Mallyx attacks. This party member then resurrects everyone except a [[pull]]er outside and then the party pulls Mallyx to the gate and fights him there. The following are the basics of the build (allowing for modifications to defeat the earlier mobs):
  *A few Elementalists with Air Magic spells. These can be replace with [[Blood Magic]] spikers.
  *One Necromancer with [[Necrotic Traversal]] or [[Consume Corpse]] along with [[Rebirth]]. This necromancer must also have a self-sacrifice skill such as [[Blood is Power]] or [[Blood Ritual]]. It is extremely useful if this necromancer can bring [[Signet of Sorrow]].
  *One party member with [[Animate Flesh Golem]] (this is usually not the Necromancer as the Golem should be as low in level as possible, the Air elementalists make a good candidate as they can spike without an elite).
  *One party member with [[Resurrect]] and another with [[Rebirth]].
  *Preferably, one party member with [[Shelter]] and [[Displacement]].
  
  After the party overcomes the mobs assaulting the priest, the necromancer kills himself and then the party member with Animate Flesh Golem makes a golem out of his corpse. As soon as the Golem dies, the party enters the gate to close it and then step forward to aggro Mallyx. As soon as Mallyx is aggroed, the Necromancer jumps out to the corpse of the Golem using a corpse travel skill and the rest of the party tries to die as close as possible to the gate.
  
  The necromancer should then start [[Rebirth]]ing people through the gate to his/her side except the puller. The puller should be resurrected with Resurrection Chant (or if that puller's corspe was kicked by Mallyx's attacks) then Resurrect. It is wise to keep one party member dead at the door in case the puller gets killed too far away from the door for Resurrect to work. In which case, the dead member is resurrected, and he/she can rebirth the puller from where Mallyx kicked their corpse.
  
  Once the party is set the puller should bring Mallyx to the gate. As soon as Mallyx approach the gate he will try to go for a target. Everyone should stand a few steps away from the door and stand perfectly still. Mallyx cannot hit anyone unless they are standing right in front of the gate. People have a tendency to start running around when they see him coming, but he will be literally quite harmless. 
  
  If done correctly, Mallyx should keep grinding at the gate trying to get to some party member. If no one runs around, he will stay there. The party should begin spiking him (Signet of Sorrow works wonders with a dead party member next to Mallyx, 79 damage per second). The spawns he calls forth at 80% and 50% health will be far from the gate and should pose no threat. Should they ever become an issue, they can be pulled and killed two at a time.
  
  Once Mallyx's health drops below 50%, the player with Shelter and Displacement needs to keep them up constantly. At some point, Mallyx might invoke Summoning Shadows if his adrenaline builds up from all the damage, and if that happens, those two spirits will guarantee he cannot wipe out party members (also consider bringing [[Ancestor's Visage]] to prevent adrenaline buildup). Should he use that skill though, everyone will be pulled to the gate (those inside will remain inside and those outside will remain outside). Therefore, those outside, should just take one step away from the door so as not to be hit and at the same time not lose Mallyx's aggro and cause him to run back when he is so low in health.
  
  '''Notes:'''
  *Mallyx's aggro range is huge. He will start rushing creatures from far away. 
  *If Mallyx runs off, the party should examine his movement. If he is restlessly moving around, this means he will be back in a few minutes. If he is still, this means he has lost aggro. Again, re-aggroing him can be done from quite a distance.
  *Sometimes it takes leaving 2 or 3 people inside the gate to get him to stay at the gate and not just run off after he kills the puller.

  ==Follow-up==
  The mission is repeatable, but only in combination with the quest "[[Mallyx the Unyielding (Quest)|Mallyx the Unyielding]]." Having finished the mission switches the status of the quest to "completed", and Zhellix will not perform the opening ritual any more, so the mission becomes inaccessible. In order to gain access to the Citadel again, players must claim the quest reward and do the entire quest again, including beating the four [[Lord of Anguish|Lords of Anguish]].

  For 5 seconds, target foe moves, attacks, and uses skills up to 80% slower; suffers {{gr2|-1|24}} Health degeneration; and loses {{gr2|3|81}} Health each second.
  
  ==Notes==
  This potent skill is the [[Mursaat]]'s greatest weapon. Against an unprotected target, it's nearly guaranteed to kill.  To make matters worse, they and their [[Jade construct]]s will use this skill as often as it's recharge allows.  The only defense is [[infusion]].
  
  ===Infusion===
  The ancient race of [[Seer]]s is opposed to the Mursaat and offer to aid the players by infusing the [[Spectral Essence]] of an [[Eidolon]] into their armor, granting them its natural resistance to the Mursaat's abilities.
  
  The resistance Infusion provides plays out as follows:
  
  {| border="1"
  ! Number of Infused<br>Pieces Worn !! Health<br>Degeneration !! Direct Damage<br>Per Second
  |- align="center"
  | 0 || 30 || 100
  |- align="center"
  | 1 || 13 || 42
  |- align="center"
  | 2 || 9 || 29
  |- align="center"
  | 3 || 7 || 22
  |- align="center"
  | 4 || 5 || 16
  |- align="center"
  | 5 || 3 || 9
  |}
  Note that [[Health degeneration]] caps out at -10, so any degen past that serves only to hinder health regeneration.
  
  The slowing effects of this skill seem to be reduced by infusion in a similar manner:  The first piece of armor noticably reduces the slowing and each additional piece further reduces this effect.  With a full set of infused armor, the slowing is scarcely present.
  
  ===NPCs===
  Henchmen are infused starting with the [[Thunderhead Keep]] mission, and will be infused along with player characters in the [[Iron Mines of Moladune]] mission, where the opportunity to be infused is first given.
  
  Heroes are always infused, which can be helpful in dealing with Mursaat and Jade enemies before you have the chance to receive infusion.
  
  Pets seem to also be always infused, though this makes no sense in the storyline.

  '''How do I learn new skills?'''\n\
  :''\"Well, you need to find someone who can train you. Here in Lion's Arch, I'd talk to [[Firstwatch Sergio]]. The Firstwatch can be found just to the northwest, over at the [[Lionguard]] Barracks. He'll let you know if you've got what it takes to learn a new skill.\"''\n\n\
  '''How do I get new equipment?'''\n\
  :''\"Well, depends on what you're looking for. New weapons are best gotten in battle, if you know what I mean... Though you'll find a weapon serves you best if you have it customized. Look for a [[weaponsmith]] after you find a new weapon to see its full potential.''\n\n\
  :''New [[armor]], or whatever it is you prefer to wear, that's best made by a [[crafter]]. Wouldn't want to wear something that didn't fit you right, now would you? There's a crafter right here in town, just look for the smithy's fire, right?\"''\n\n\
  '''Where else can I go?'''\n\
  :''\"Ha! There's a whole wide world out there. You can head out this north gate to explore the countryside. From there you can head west to get to the [[White Mantle]] temple. The Mantle is always looking for new recruits. If you're feeling very adventurous, you could head down to the docks.\"''\n\n\
  :'''Is the countryside dangerous?'''\n\
  ::''\"Might be a bit rough to travel by yourself, unless you're tougher than you look. Heh. But don't let that worry you. You can always find someone else to join you.\"''\n\n\

  ::''Now I was as partial to [[Dwayna]] and [[Melandru]] as the next fellow, but these gods of the White Mantle rescued us in our time of need.\"''\n\n\
  :'''Hmm. What if I get lost?'''\n\
  ::''\"If you get lost, use your map. Press \"M\" to view the map, then press \"M\" again to hide it, of course.''\n\n\

  | campaign = Nightfall
  | region = The Desolation
  | type = Challenge
  | partysize = 1
  | duration = Short
  }}
  [[Challenge Mission]]. This is a solo challenge mission. The goal is to kill as many enemies as possible without dying with help from your friendly wurm. This mission is not timed, but you are constantly under the environmental effect [[Corrupted Land]]s and so have a [[health degeneration]] of '''1'''. 
  There are 5 different areas in this challenge. You start out in the center and have 4 locked doors to the other areas at the beginning. For every 15 points you earn you unlock a new section. 
  The [[Maddened Spirit]]s are invincible and will always deal 700 damage to you until you kill a [[Greater Infestation]], which will give you the enchantment [[Spirit Form]]. This only lasts for a short period and allows you to kill the spirits. [[Lost Soul]]s will spawn at random locations on the map.
  
  The 4 types of enemies:
  *Infestation  (1 Point)
  *Greater Infestation  (3 Points)
  *Maddened Spirit  (4 Points)
  *Lost Soul  (8 Points)
  
  For every Lost Soul or Maddened Spirit you kill, you will have a random chance of acquiring [[Ancient Armor Remnants]].
  
  ==Mission information==
  ===Objectives===
  Evade angry ghosts and cleanse the tombs by killing the insects that have infested the area.
  * Evade the ghosts of the primeval kings.
  * Kill infestations to earn points.
  * Kill greater infestations to earn points and gain the temporary ability to harm ghosts.
  * Destroy lost souls to free their spirits and earn points.
  * Earn 15 points to unlock access to each section of the tombs. You have opened 0 of 4 sections.
  
  ===Rewards===
  [[Ancient Armor Remnants]] can be used to upgrade the visual appearance of [[hero armor]] to the hero version of the [[Ancient armor]] look. (Note that the hero version looks different from the player version.) This upgrade is available for Tahlkora, Zhed Shadowhoof, Master of Whispers and Margrid the Sly.
  
  ==Tactics==
  The [[Paragon]] skill, [["Can't Touch This!"]], will protect you from the Maddened Spirit's Maddened Strike. 
  
  The best method so far to gain points quickly is to camp near a Greater Infestation and keep it near death as you kill Infestations. Keep an eye on your radar and watch for a moving red dot, then as the Maddened Spirit gets near you kill the Greater Infestation. You should then be able to kill the spirit and move on to camp the next Greater Infestation. 
  
  The best method for getting lost souls is to kill the first few Maddened Spirit's until you have unlocked two areas. Then, start running in your wurm through the areas. There are 3 spawn points in the North West corner (one on rocky ground), Three in the North Eastern Corner, One in the South Eastern corner (on rocky ground) and two in the South Western Corner. When you start running, go through each area methodically, scanning for lost souls. Do not fight the ghosts. Let them chase you and use your tunnel skill to keep ahead of them. When you find a lost soul, make sure you have some space between you and the spirits before you kill it. Then, tunnel quickly away. 
  
  For souls on rocky ground, have at least 2 aggro circles' distance between you and the spirits before having the wurm spit you out. You will need a running skill (perhaps two) and enough damage to kill the soul quickly. 
  
  To heal you can either build up your adrenaline and use Junundu Smash to KD a mob then use Junundu Bite (given that the first attack doesn't kill your target) to heal for 500 hp. You can also use Junundu Tunnel then use Junundu Bite to KD and heal for 500 hp. You can also use Junundu Wail to heal for 500 hp if there are no enemies near you and you are near a wurm spoor. 
  
  Another way to heal is to get a new wurm, but you are very vulnerable while doing this so be careful. 
  
  Maddened Spirits are unaffected by hexes and conditions .
  
  If you wish to focus on getting [[Ancient Armor Remnants]], you may want to equip a few speed stances, because Lost Souls may spawn where your wurm cannot go to, and you'll have to run away from the Maddened Spirits the whole time for the least time-consuming method. Note that after you have received 4 armour pieces, the drop rate appears to drop significantly.

  ==Notes==

  ==The Kirin, the embodiment of corruption==
  
  ''Kaijun Don was a healer of breathtaking beauty who showed compassion to any who sought her aid, including those who could not pay her. Unfortunately, Kaijun Don caught the eye of a cruel gang leader. When she refused his offer of courtship, his men attacked her, scarring her lovely face past all recognition. When Kaijun's scars proved immune to even her own strong magic, she became enraged and swore revenge upon her attackers. Over the years, her quest for vengeance became an obsession that blackened her soul, until at last she made a pact with a demon who promised powerful magics in return for completing the horrific ritual that would make him flesh. Kaijun did not hesitate, and the killings she performed that day left her forever corrupted.''

No doubt her home is far away from the horrors of war and the nightmarish abominations that stalk scorched wastelands. She certainly seems well-educated in the myths and lore of the land, but her practical education needs a bit more work. As a young woman dreaming of heroic triumphs, Talkhora'' [sic] ''has diligently studied tales of romance and high adventure. She's as fluent with the folk tales of [[Istan]]i commoners as she is with the thrilling narratives of great literature. Now that she's seen what adventuring is like in the real world, however, the difference between dreams and reality is rapidly becoming more apparent.''\n\n\

  Near the [[Fortress of Jahai]], a monument endures as a testament to '''Turai Ossa''', the savior of [[Elona]]. On that site hundreds of years ago, Turai Ossa defeated the undead lord [[Palawa Joko]], the Scourge of Vabbi\xE2\x80\x94an event that brought the end of an era, and the dawn of a new one.\n\n\
  Since the [[Shattered Dynasty Era]], the three provinces of Elona\xE2\x80\x94[[Vabbi]], [[Istan]], and [[Kourna]]\xE2\x80\x94had kept their distance from foreign politics. Each province had its own plans for their defense against outsiders. The province of Kourna had a strong army, and the Istani were known for a navy diligently watching the waters. In the days of Turai, however, the merchant princes of Vabbi were confident that treacherous terrain to the north would prevent invaders from threatening their lands\xE2\x80\x94a mistake that would prove fatal.\n\n\
  Palawa Joko led an army of invaders through the [[Vehjin Mines|Vabbian mines]], cautiously infiltrating Elona\xE2\x80\x99s northernmost province. Loyal guards stood watch over the estates of the merchant princes, but they were unprepared for the advance of an entire army. Caught by  surprise, those loyal to Vabbi fell quickly. With lightning-fast raids, the Scourge of Vabbi captured the estates of the Vabbi\xE2\x80\x99s wealthy, driving his enemies before him.\n\n\
  From there, Palawa ruthlessly and systematically conquered the nation, piece by piece. Over many months, he drove back the armies of\n\
  Elona, growing stronger with each conquest. Triumphantly, Palawa Joko proclaimed himself the nation\xE2\x80\x99s sovereign, beginning an era of\n\
  tyranny and oppression. Within two years, the Kournan army had been reduced to a struggling rebellion, an alliance of fugitives\n\
  led by a single renegade warmarshal: Turai Ossa.\n\n\
  Using the desperate tactics of hit-and-run warfare, Warmarshal Turai harried and hunted Lord Joko\xE2\x80\x99s soldiers whenever possible. The last remnants of the Kournan army were desperate for victory, but they could not last forever. His loyal followers were eventually surrounded near the [[Grand Cataract of Jahai]], where they prepared to make their final stand.\n\n\
  The defeat of Turai would have meant an end to freedom in Elona, and his army would not surrender or relent. The result was a bloodbath that lasted for days. Each time night fell, the battleground remained unchanged, as neither army gave ground to the other. To stop the slaughter, Turai Ossa bravely challenged the enemy commander to single combat. At dawn, Ossa and Joko locked swords... and the monument in Jahai now shows the exact location where Ossa finally triumphed over the Scourge of Vabbi. \n\n\
  Elona was humbled, but ready to rebuild. Shaken and stunned, the people of Elona rallied behind Turai Ossa. The princes of Vabbi\n\
  used their recaptured wealth to rebuild what had been destroyed. Some believe Turai had been chosen by the five true gods to free his nation, and many saw his victory as a sign of divine favor. The people of Kourna praised him as their warmarshal, and the rest of the nation was in desperate need of leadership. Soon thereafter, Turai was anointed as the king of all Elona. King Turai Ossa had succeeded where generations of Pretender Kings had failed, unifying the nation as one people.\n\n\
  King Turai had wealth, power, and influence, but he yearned for loftier goals. Openly, he ruled a grateful populace, but secretly, he spent his nights studying ancient wisdom. The more he read, the more he contemplated the role of the gods in his life. If he had been chosen by the gods as the savior of his nation, perhaps he was destined for greater accomplishments.\n\n\
  Musing on mysteries, Ossa sought his answers by seeking Ascension, a state of communion with the gods. He knew the path to that ideal\n\
  ran through the wasteland north of Elona\xE2\x80\x94lands that had been ruled by Palawa Joko years before. Turai stepped down from his position of authority, passing the title of warmarshal to his son, [[Kunai Ossa|Kunai]]. Since that time, the title of warmarshal has been a hereditary one in Kourna, passed down through the many generations of Turai Ossa\xE2\x80\x99s descendents.\n\n\
  Turai and his followers then began a great pilgrimage, marching north into the [[Crystal Desert]], where the gods once walked among men. His loyal entourage erected temples, raising pillars toward the heavens... but [[Ascension]] eluded him. Instead of everlasting life, he found the torment of eternal living death. In ghostly form, he still walks the earth. Many of his followers died as well, and their ghosts have remained in the Crystal Desert.\n\n\
  Some Elonians remember Turai for his heroism; others remember him as a madman whose false pride led him on a doomed pilgrimage. Since\n\
  that bygone age, no one ruler has reigned over all Elona\xE2\x80\x94the three provinces have remained separate, but equal. Yet to this day, Turai Ossa\xE2\x80\x99s descendents still rule over Kourna. Warmarshal [[Varesh Ossa]] represents the latest generation; and she shares her  ancestor\xE2\x80\x99s fascination with the role of the gods in the lives of mere men and women.\n\n\
  As for Turai, he maintains his vigil over Elona, guiding others who follow the path of heroes. Scholars of lore know of him as the savior of Kourna, the man who single-handedly defeated the Scourge of Vabbi\xE2\x80\x94but for many, he is simply the [[Ghostly Hero]], a champion who stalks the troubled wastelands north of Elona, eternally ready to stand beside its heroes.\n\n\

  '''How did you know I was Chosen?'''\n\
  :''\"For many centuries have I lingered here in this desert, waiting for the Prophecy to come to pass. The Chosen ones will come and help me gain access to the Mists and pass into the Hall of Heroes. It has all been foreseen.\"''\n\n\
  '''The Hall of Heroes?'''\n\
  :''\"Deep within [[The Mists|the Mists]] is a place known as the [[Hall of Heroes]]. This is the spot where the universe was created, the very center of all things. It is the dream of all heroes that when they die, their spirit goes to the Hall, to float among other legendary figures of old.\"''\n\n\
  '''Why do you need my help?'''\n\
  :''\"Like you, I was one of the Chosen. But I passed from this world before I could rise to [[Ascension]]. The tests of Ascension can only be performed by mortals. But I can guide you through them, and when the way opens for you, it can also open for me.\"''\n\n\
  '''Who were you in life?'''\n\
  :''\"My name was Turai Ossa. I was the Champion of [[Elona]], the protector and leader of my people. At the [[Battle of Jahai]], I single-handedly defeated [[Palawa Joko]], the scourge of [[Vabbi]]. It was I who led the Elonians to the [[Crystal Desert]].\"''\n\n\
  '''Have others come to the desert to Ascend?'''\n\
  :''\"Since my own people perished here, there have been two other groups who have followed suit, failing as we did to Ascend. The ghosts of many of their strongest spiritual leaders still haunt this place.\"''\n\n\
  '''Is that what happened to you?'''\n\
  :''\"I perished, along with the rest of my people, trying to build a temple to the old gods. We foolishly thought that we were the ones in the [[Flameseeker Prophecies]]. The ones who would rise to be led to the Hall. But fate is a cruel master, and it is I who have become the guide.\"''\n\n\
  '''What do you know of the Flameseeker Prophecies?'''\n\
  :''\"I know that those who are proven worthy will help me open the way into the [[Rift]]. I know that those who Ascend are destined for greatness. And I know that it will be I who leads them through the treacherous afterlife to the top of the [[Hall of Heroes]]. But if you wish to know more, then you should ask the one who had the premonitions, the Prophet.\"''\n\n\
  '''The Prophet still lives?'''\n\
  :''\"Indeed. Her name is [[Glint]], and she is quite old, even for a dragon.\"''\n\n\
  '''A dragon?'''\n\
  :''\"Yes. She was the first of all creatures on Tyria, created by the gods to be the caretaker, but it became clear that she needed help. That is when they summoned the creatures known now only as the [[Forgotten]].\"''\n\n\
  '''What are the Forgotten?'''\n\
  :''\"They resemble great snakes, but they move upright, use magic, and fight with forged weapons. They were brought here to watch over Tyria while the gods completed their creation. But the serpentine creatures were pushed out of most of the continent, banished here to the desert by humans. Now they serve to protect the portal to the dragon's lair. If you want to ascend and meet Glint, you will have to get by them.\"''\n\n\
  '''How do I find Glint?'''\n\
  :''\"She lives here in the Crystal Desert. But she is not easy to find. Her lair is inside a single crystalline grain of sand. It would take you a million lifetimes to comb the desert and you would still never find her. Only those who Ascend will find the portal that takes them to her.\"''\n\n\
  '''What must I do?'''\n\
  :''\"You will have to prove to the gods that you are worthy of Ascension. There are three test you must pass before you will be let into the mesa at [[Augury Rock]]. The mesa lies to the east. There you will find [[Great Ritual Priest Zahmut]]. He can tell you more.\"''\n\n\
  '''I'll head east then.'''\n\
  :''\"I have waited for a long time for someone worthy to help me pass into the Rift. For both of our sakes, I wish you luck.\"''\n\n\
  ====In The [[Dunes of Despair (outpost)|Dunes of Despair]]====\n\
  :''\"Long have I waited under the desert sun for one such as you. Though I am not affected by its rays, it torments me nonetheless.  What I wouldn't give for just one more chance to feel its warmth....''\n\
  :''What is it you seek?\"''\n\n\
  '''Tell me what lies ahead.'''\n\
  :''\"The test in the Dunes of Despair lies inside the [[Temple of Ascension]].\"''\n\n\
  '''The Temple of Ascension?'''\n\
  :''\"The Temple of Ascension is where the gods focus their gaze when they look down upon [[Tyria (world)|Tyria]].\"''\n\n\
  '''Why would the gods gaze upon Tyria?'''\n\
  :''\"Mortals are always of interest to the gods. We are their creations, and despite the fact that they left this world, they are still curious about our comings and goings. If the mortals near the temple are worthy of being seen, the gods will gaze down from the Mists upon the Throne of Pellentia. Those standing upon the throne will be judged.''\n\
  :''Draw the attention of the gods, and withstand the light of their gaze. If you survive, you will be one step closer to Ascending.\"''\n\n\
  '''How did a temple get in the middle of the desert?'''\n\
  :''\"When my people came to the desert in search of Ascension, we built many structures. The Temple of Ascension was one of them. We thought that the higher we built our structures, the closer we would be to the gods. We did not understand what it meant to Ascend.  Despite ourselves, we managed to get the attentinon of the gods. But now there is another spirit who controls the throne, and until we take it from him, we will not get the attention of the gods.\"''\n\n\
  '''What must I do?'''\n\
  :''\"Take me to the Temple of Ascension. There we will open the gates and retake the throne from the usurper.\"''\n\n\
  '''I'm with you.'''\n\
  :''\"We draw closer to your Ascension and our journey into the Rift.\"''\n\n\
  ====In [[Elona Reach (outpost)|Elona Reach]]====\n\
  :''\"Your Ascension is close at hand. But do not let your success go to your head. I was once mortal like you. I thought I had everything well in hand. That was hundreds of years ago, but I have yet to reach the Hall of Heroes.''\n\
  :''What is it you seek?\"''\n\n\
  '''What challenge must I face here in the Reach?'''\n\
  :''\"This is where my people, the Elonians, met their untimely end, trying to assemble the Vision Crystal.\"''\n\n\
  '''What Happened?'''\n\
  :''\"The desire for control is a powerful thing. The minds of mortal men are torn asunder with thoughts of greatness. And as is the case with many men who have achieved some power, they desire more and more until finally they either get it or destroy themselves trying.\"''\n\n\
  '''I do not understand.'''\n\
  :''\"In our struggle for more power, there was no one we would not struggle against... even ourselves. We were unable to work together to pass the test of the Vision Crystal. Greed separated my people, made them turn on each other, made their leaders turn on each other, and in the end, it was to be our undoing.\"''\n\n\
  '''The Vision Crystal?'''\n\
  :''\"It is a powerful artifact that can focus the gaze of the gods upon you. Without it, you will be unable to Ascend. Once you have completed the three Tests of Ascension, you will head to Augury Rock. There, the gaze of the gods will be focused by the Vision Crystal upon you. If you pass their scrutiny, you will be allowed to enter the final test and prove yourself worthy of Ascension once and for all.\"''\n\n\
  '''What must I do?'''\n\
  :''\"Retrieve the three shards of the Vision Crystal and help me fuse them back together.\"''\n\n\
  '''Consider it done.'''\n\
  :''\"I admire your confidence. Let us hope you do better than I did when I was in your place.\"''\n\n\
  ====In [[Thirsty River (outpost)|Thirsty River]]====\n\
  :''\"A test of the mighty awaits you.''\n\
  :''What is it you seek?\"''\n\n\
  '''Why do the buildings here appear to be made from boats?'''\n\
  :''\"Like most others who have come to the [[Crystal Desert]], the [[Margonites]] arrived expecting to be able to find a physical means with which to reach the heavens. All they found was disappointment, an endless supply of sand, and eventually their own mortality.\"''\n\n\
  '''The Margonites?'''\n\
  :''\"Very much like my people, the Elonians, they were simply a misguided group who came to the desert to be heard by their gods.\"''\n\n\
  '''How did they get here?'''\n\
  :''\"It might be hard to believe but many hundreds of years ago, much of the sand and sun-baked dunes were completely underwater. The Margonites, as you might have surmised by their architecture, were a sea-going culture, and they simply floated their way out here, looking for [[Ascension]], backed when only the tops of dunes stuck out of the water.''\n\
  :''They did not understand there is no earthly way to reach Ascension. Only by proving yourself worthy to the gods will they allow you access to their realm.\"''\n\n\
  '''What happened to the Margonites? '''\n\
  :''\"They built towers, like so many others have, hoping to climb into the heavens and to come face-to-face with their gods, foolishly thinking they could read their petitions to Dwayna, Balthazar, and Melandru from their own lips. Their towers remain standing to this day, an eternal testament to their failure. Understand this: Ascension must be earned, and even then, only those few who are worthy of being raised to such a level will be admitted. All others will fall to the wayside, toiling in obscurity for a goal they cannot reach or becoming trapped like me, forced to wait for an eternity, their fate resting in the hands of someone they have not yet met.\"''\n\n\
  '''What must I do?'''\n\
  :''\"You must make your way to the Rune Circle. There you will be cleaned of your earthly sins in preparation of your being gazed upon by the gods.\"''\n\n\
  ====In The [[Tomb of the Primeval Kings]]====\n\
  :''\"Chaos reigns at the [[Tomb of the Primeval Kings]]! I never thought I would see the day. For centuries I have joined forces with those bold ones who sought to reach the [[Hall of Heroes]] from these sacred grounds... and I was doing just that when the world went mad. One moment I was moving to claim the center of the [[Hall of Heroes|Hall]]; the next, darkness filled my vision and twisted nightmarish creatures erupted from everywhere at once. My allies were besieged, and I could not reach them... all I could do was fight my way through the darkness to get to the world outside. Their dying screams still ring in my spectral ears.''\n\
  :''These abominations must be stopped. They cannot be allowed to reach and corrupt any more gateways into the [[Hall of Heroes]].\"''\n\n\

  | campaign = Nightfall\n\
  }}\n\
  [[Acolyte Jin]] is a [[hero]] available in [[Guild Wars Nightfall]]. A quiet, deadly member of the [[Zaishen Order]], Jin seeks a suitable teacher.\n\n\
  From the [http://www.guildwars.com/theworld/heroes/ official website] and the manual:\n\
  :''Grim Zaishen Archer''\n\
  ::''\"Actions, not words.\"''\n\n\
  :'''Origin:''' [[Cantha]]n<br>\n\
  :'''Age:''' 17<br>\n\
  :'''Profession:''' [[Ranger]]\n\n\
  :''When Jin was a young girl growing up on the coast of Cantha, her family was slain by monstrous creatures in the dead of night. From that moment on, she trained as an archer, determined that the forces of darkness would never take her by surprise again. For hours, she silently practiced with her bow, taking some small measure of comfort in the sound of a bowstring releasing or the menace of an arrow in flight. Even before she joined the Zaishen Order, she was a determined and deadly adversary, and their instruction has made her even more dangerous.''\n\n\
  :''Traveling with others makes her feel a little safer, but she considers the concept of \"safety in numbers\" a delusion. In the end, she knows it's her own skill that means the difference between life and death. She does not care about rank or status in the Zaishen Order. Each day she systematically eliminates another monster threatening Elona, she finds it a little easier to survive one more night of troubled sleep.''\n\n\

  Acolyte Jin starts with ranger Zaishen armor, which has the appearance of undyed [[Ranger Shing Jea armor]], and a Zaishen mask as the headgear. Her armor has an [[armor rating]] of 25 to 70, depending on her level.\n\n\
  The appearance of her armor can be upgraded to [[Elite Sunspear armor]] using [[Stolen Sunspear Armor]] acquired from the [[Dajkah Inlet]] [[Challenge Mission]], or to [[Primeval armor]] using [[Primeval Armor Remnants]] acquired in the [[Domain of Anguish]] and during [[the Ebony Citadel of Mallyx]] mission.\n\n\
  ==Dialogue==\n\
  In Sun Docks, Plains of Jarin, and Zehlon Reach:\n\
  :''\"My family was killed because they weren't prepared for danger. The Zaishen rescued me. I vowed to prepare myself for the perils of life and learned the ways of the bow from an early age. Lead me through danger and my arrows will darken the sky above your path.\"''\n\n\
  In Throne of Secrets:\n\
  :''\"I told you once before: there is no danger so great that a courageous heart cannot overcome it\"''\n\n\

  ==Notes==
  Barring the use of [[blindness]] inducing skill (such as [[Blinding Flash]] or [[Throw Dirt]]), it is highly advisable for spellcasters to avoid direct confrontation with these monsters. Abyssals are capable of dishing out great damage, knockdowns and brutal [[interrupt]]s. They can take out a caster in three hits, during which the victim will not have a chance to cast anything or run far. 
  
  [[Weakness]] inducing skills (like [[Enervating Charge]] and [[Staggering Blow]]) are useful in that they give the victims of the Abyssals time to run by reducing the damage of these creatures.
  
  Overall, the true weakness of these creatures is that they do not possess any [[condition]] removal skills nor are they ever around any other mobs that do. As such, hindering them with [[trap]]s and/or conditions is quite effective.
  
  Another effective strategy for taking down Abyssals, is a spirit spammer.  With appropriate spirits, a [[Ritualist]] can easily take down these creatures.

  | preceded by = [[Horde of Darkness]]
  | followed by = [[Uncharted Territory]]}}
  The objective of ''Ruins of Morah'' is simply to kill [[Varesh]] in one last attempt to prevent her from bringing about Nightfall.
  
  Varesh has two forms, a [[Dervish]] and a [[Paragon]] form which she transforms into once you kill the Dervish form. Destroy any monsters who spawn with her then kill Varesh herself. 
  
  ==Mission information==
  ===Requirements===
  Make sure you have [[General Morgahn]] in your party to enter the mission.
  
  ===Objective===
  Kill Varesh.
  
  ===Reward===
  The reward is based on the time it takes for you to kill Varesh.
  {{Mission reward
  | objective = Time taken (minutes)
  | standard = > 12
  | expert = < 12
  | master = < 8 
  | hardstd = > 14
  | hardexp = < 14
  | hardmstr = < 10}}
  
  ==Walkthrough==
  The following strategy is successful for completing the mission at Master's level without too much trouble.
  
  Varesh is situated in a crater in her [[Prophet Varesh]] form which is a Dervish. When you enter take note of where you came in and then head straight for Varesh and the three [[Margonite Cleric]]s which accompany her in the middle of the crater. Kill the clerics first while trying to stay out of Varesh's way. Once the clerics are gone start working on Varesh - she takes a bit to kill. If you can stage your fight out of the crater towards where you spawned for the mission it'll make the next stage a little easier. If you keep her blind or slowed, you can seriously impede her ability to damage using her scythe. Watch for [[Earth Vortex]] and [[Frost Vortex]] and try to stay out of their area of effect while you work on Varesh.
  
  When you've killed Prophet Varesh head straight up the hill to where you spawned and stand against the gate blocking the way. If you're using henchies flag them right on the gate. This fuss is because Varesh's skill [[Enemies Must Die!]] means that any enemies in the area will target the one character resulting in a rather scary spike. To prevent this the demons are taken care of first. Soon [[Torment creature]]s will start to spawn around the crater and Varesh will be reborn in the middle of the crater as [[Commander Varesh]], a Paragon. 
  
  Three Demon groups of two will spawn in front of you, one group after the others. Pull the first group which spawned up to where you are standing - the others will start a circuit of the crater. This is the first encounter with Torment Demons which all use [[Call to the Torment]]. This skill allows the demon to duplicate once it reaches under about 1/3 of its health. It is important to focus fire on a single called target to quickly and efficiently kill the demon before it duplicates. Eliminate the group you pull, and contine pulling the wandering groups one at a time to the place where you stand. Varesh may come as well occasionally, but with two enemies her skill isn't as deadly because the pressure isn't as great.
  
  When the demons are dealt with come down the hill a bit to fight Varesh in a spot where she doesn't run away all the time. Use your anti-attack skills while killing Varesh to finish the mission.
  
  A similar strategy is to run straight ahead to the other end of the map instead of back to the entrance and start eliminating groups from that direction before fighting Varesh. This is effective, but it will make it unlikely to get Masters as you will have to wait until all groups spawn and walk in your direction. The previous strategy is harder, as the enemy groups will spawn very close to your party, but it is faster since you don't have to kill all enemy groups, only those closer to you and Varesh.
  
  ==Skill recommendations==
  *Bring [[Lightbringer's Gaze]]
  *Anti-attack skills such as those which cause blind like [[Ineptitude]] or [[Blinding Flash]] or slow the rate of attack like [[Faintheartedness]]
  *[[Spoil Victor]] is effective against Commander Varesh, but is not effective against Prophet Varesh because she usually runs around creating vortexes rather than continuously attacking.

  }}\n\
  [[Koss]] is one of the [[hero]]es (customizable party NPCs) available in [[Guild Wars Nightfall]]. A cheerful, boisterous fellow Sunspear, Koss has almost as much faith in you as he does in himself. His family name is Dejarin. His father is [[Zudash Dejarin]] and his sister is [[Ailonseh Dejarin]]. He left on bad terms with his father when he decided to join the [[Order of the Sunspears]].\n\n\
  From the [http://www.guildwars.com/theworld/heroes/ official website]:\n\
  :''Relentless Adventurer''\n\
  ::''\"Trust me on this one.\"''\n\n\
  :'''Origin:''' [[Kournan]]<br>\n\
  :'''Age:''' 25<br>\n\
  :'''Profession:''' [[Warrior]]\n\n\
  :''An idealistic and brutally effective soldier, Koss has great hopes for the latest generation of Sunspears. He's proud of what they've done, sometimes to the point of arrogance. With brute strength and overwhelming confidence, he cheerfully muscles his way through one confrontation after another, often using the same approach when dealing with people. For the good of the Order, he's used a combination of ruthless charisma, physical intimidation, and flexible morality to build up a network of contacts and informants. Of course, some of those contacts aren't entirely trustworthy. Dealing with the dregs of the underworld has its risks, but when the fate of his homeland is at stake, he'll do whatever it takes to keep [[Elona]] safe. When push comes to shove, Koss is a loyal ally, a dedicated Elonian, and most importantly, a two-hundred-and-fifty-pound fighting machine.''\n\n\
  From the manual:\n\
  :''Koss can find a way to get along with just about anyone. He gets along with heroes, doing whatever it takes to help the Sunspears protect Elona. He\xE2\x80\x99s courageous enough to say what others are afraid to say, and he'll do what others are afraid to do. He also gets along with the less respectable representatives of Elonian society. For the good of the Order, he's used a combination of aggressive charisma, physical intimidation, and sympathetic morality to build up a network of informants. Of course, some of those contacts aren't entirely trustworthy, which means his information has a price.''\n\n\
  :''Because of a few questionable deals with informers, Koss doesn't entirely get along with his commanding officers. He's managed to talk his way out of being discharged outright, but his extralegal activities have taken a toll on his career. He's skillful enough in combat that he should be an officer by now, but an officer with contacts in the underworld is a risk the Sunspears can't afford to take. Despite that, he knows their investigations need information, so as a loyal Elonian, he'll keep doing what it takes to save his country... no matter how much of a personal sacrifice that might be.''\n\n\

  '''Margrid''', also known as Margrid the Sly, is one of the [[hero]]es available in [[Guild Wars Nightfall]]. A mercenary corsair, Margrid sees you first as potential targets and only later as allies.\n\n\

  :'''Profession:''' [[Ranger]]\n\n\
  :''A native of Freeman's Cove, Margrid was born a sailor. She took her first steps on the rolling deck of a sailing ship, and she proudly claims to have sea water in her veins. She's not just a corsair\xE2\x80\x94she's the descendant of generations of corsairs, a woman who knows no other way of life. Life on land seems strange, predictable, and dull by comparison. People on land have vastly different ideas about morality and business, but for her, the Code of the Corsair is as immutable as the laws of nature. Land-dwellers sometimes regard her as a little shady, overly cynical, and blatantly self-interested, but those qualities are essential to anyone who survives in a world troubled by pirates and thieves. She's learned to roll with the punches, coping with everything life throws at her. Anyone who travels with Margrid should be ready for an exciting, dangerous journey. If Margrid has anything to say about it, the venture will be eminently profitable as well.''\n\n\

  The [[Dwarf|Dwarves]] have also fully explored along the entire length of the [[Shiverpeaks|Shiverpeak]] mountain range, even into the [[Far Shiverpeaks]] north of civilized lands. [[King Jalis Ironhammer|King Jalis]] himself accompanied a small expedition into these lands to meet with leaders of the [[Norn]]\xE2\x80\x94a race long-known to the Dwarves of old.\n\n\
  These towering half-giants look generally human in appearance but have limited interest in the affairs of races beyond the mountains. Fiercely independent, the Norn are not organized into a single nation. Instead, they place immense value on individual prowess and skill in battle. The most famous hunters among their race establish homesteads that become havens of safety, but no single Norn rules, nor seeks to rule. Both genders hunt and fight, and physical strength is, perhaps, the most highly regarded trait in a mate.\n\n\

My two apprentices can teach you much about being an Assassin, and about balance. One is an extremely talented young man named Jinzo, the other is Panaku. They are two sides of the same coin. Jinzo thinks of his path in terms of duty, [[Panaku]] in terms of pleasure. If you are ready to begin, find '''Jinzo''' in '''Sunqua Vale''' for your first lesson.\n\n\

  ===Intermediate dialogue===\n\
  '''Headmaster Lee'''\n\
  :''\"Since you have not yet chosen a secondary profession, when I teach you these Assassin skills, you will lose the '''current secondary profession''' skills you have now.\n\n\

  == Notes ==
  *This spell actually inflicts {{gr|5|20}} [[fire damage]] for each second the spell has been in effect, starting at the ''end'' of the first second.
  *In order to max out the effect in both PvE and PvP play it is best to use a snare to keep the target in AoE range. Also a [[knock down]] ([[Gale]]) can be very useful right after casting this spell. [[Frozen Burst]] works fairly well with Savannah Heat, and better if you plan to use other [[PBAoE]] skills such as [[Inferno]] and [[Flame Djinn's Haste]].

  *Mending is a notoriously poor performer in terms of [[energy]] used per healing gained. Since it is a maintained enchantment, it is best used on oneself when sustained passive healing is needed, such as moving through an area with [[Health degeneration]] and/or enemies who might [[interrupt]] healing attempts.
  *A famous joke is to use the skill [[Echo]] before using this skill, you'll have two Mendings on your bar and will be invincible. "Echo Mending, gg".

  '''[[Headmaster Greico]]'''\n\
  :''\"[[Master Togo]] has gone to the palace to see if the emperor has any useful information about the plague. As I am sure you know, the emperor and [[Master Togo]] are brothers... [[Master Togo]]'s mother caught the eye of [[Emperor Kintah]], our current emperor's father. Not many are allowed into the emperor's palace, but he permits [[Master Togo]] entry because of their shared blood.''\n\
  :''While we wait, I have a task for you. I sent some of the other '''monastery students''' out into '''[[Wajjun Bazaar]]''' to speak with the locals to gather information about this plague. I'd appreciate it if you could find out what they have learned and then report your information to [[Master Togo]]. The information may prove invaluable in determining the source of the plague.\"''\n\
  :'''Accept:''' ''\"I'll go find out what I can.\"''\n\
  :'''Decline:''' ''\"I'd rather stay here with you on the docks.\"''\n\
  :'''When asked about quest:''' ''\"'''[[Lo Sha]]''' and the other headmasters and students are in the '''Bazaar''' gathering what information they can about the plague. I'm certain they could use your help.\"''\n\n\
  === Intermediate Dialogue ===\n\n\
  '''[[Kisai]]'''\n\
  :''\"[[Headmaster Greico]] sent you? This is reassuring. I went to visit my family to make sure they were all right. Apparently my sister left for the [[Echovald Forest]] to study painting. This is so scary, do you not think? I found out from my mother that the [[Obsidian Flame]] guild is helping the guards keep the guards keep the city from falling apart because of this plague. I am sure with [[Master Togo]]'s training I can make it through. Fear cuts deeper than a blade; I've got to remember that.\"''\n\n\
  '''[[Mai]]'''\n\
  :''\"This is why we studied under [[Master Togo]], is it not? Talking with my old friends I have discovered that this plague came out of nowhere. The emperor is doing all he can, but apparently it is not enough. To all things must come an end, and this plague is no different.\"''\n\n\
  '''[[Aeson]]'''\n\
  :''\"These streets are strange and hard to navigate. To be honest I feel less of an outsider here than I did back on the [[Jade Sea]]. I overheard some traders talking of the [[Luxons]] and it seems that our nomadic ways have prevented the plague from affecting my people.\n\n\
  '''[[Yuun]]'''\n\
  :''\"This is not a game anymore. I tracked down some of the plague creatures, but thought it best to keep my distance and observe them for a while instead of rushing in like I might once have done. While I was waiting, I talked with a [[Kurzick]] from [[Echovald Forest]]. He was saying that the war between [[Luxon]] and [[Kurzick]] continues apace. Old hatreds can burn for generations, eh?\"''\n\n\
  '''[[Lukas]]'''\n\
  :''\"Looks like another opportunity for Lukas the Great. Do you like the new title? I think it most befitting in such a great city. This adventure in [[Cantha]] will be just the thing to impress [[Danika]]. [[Master Togo]] just passed through here looking for [[Jinzo]]. He had sent the two of us here to look into possible causes of this plague, but once [[Jinzo]] saw the destruction in this place, he went a bit crazy and ran off into the sewers. I would have gone after him, of course, but I had more heroic things to do.\"''\n\n\

  After you help [[Devona]] defeat the [[Grawl]] attack in the [[Trouble in the Woods]] quest, Prince Rurik asks that you investigate how the Charr Ranger seen leading the Grawl attack is getting into Ascalon without anyone the wiser.  \n\n\
  ==Quest information==\n\
  ===Requirements===\n\
  * [[Prophecies]] character\n\n\
  ===Objectives===\n\
  * Find out if the Charr Ranger is using the [[catacombs]]. Speak to [[Brother Mhenlo]] in [[Ashford Abbey]].\n\
  * Ask [[Necromancer Munne]] if she has any information on the Charr.\n\
  * Seek out [[Oberan the Reviled]] deep within the catacombs. Ask him about the Charr Ranger.\n\
  * Return to [[Rurik]] in [[Ascalon City]] and show him the sharp charr tooth.\n\n\
  ===Reward===\n\
  * 250 [[Experience]]\n\
  * 100 [[Gold]]\n\n\
  ==Walkthrough==\n\
  Simply go to Ashford Abbey, talk to Brother Mhenlo. Necromancer Munne is to your right as you enter the Catacombs. Oberan the Reviled is a bit harder to get to, as you have to fight your way through various undead and Deadly Crypt Spiders. Getting to Oberan the Reviled is the majority of the quest, and is the hardest and most time consuming. The Mission Map might help. Press U to bring it up. After you obtain the Sharp Charr Tooth from him, you can just map back to Ascalon City for your reward.\n\n\
  ==Dialogue==\n\
  ===Initial dialogue===\n\
  '''Prince Rurik'''\n\
  :''\"The Charr agent that you and Devona witnessed leading the Grawl worries me greatly. I've questioned the guards and many of the townsfolk, but none have seen him. I suspect that he is using the catacombs to move through the countryside unseen. My men are all busy safeguarding the Wall, and I can spare none of them. If you are willing, I'd like you to go into the [[catacombs]] to see if you can find any evidence as to where this Charr is hiding. Perhaps [[Brother Mhenlo]] at the Abbey has seen something.\"''\n\n\
  :'''Accept:''' ''\"I will find the evidence you seek.\"''\n\
  :'''Decline:''' ''\"That sounds too risky.\"''\n\
  :'''When asked about quest:''' ''\"Ask '''Brother Mhenlo''' if he has seen this '''Charr Ranger''' near the catacombs.\"\n\n\
  ===Intermediate dialogue===\n\
  '''Brother Mhenlo'''\n\
  :''\"A Charr Ranger south of the Wall? Rurik is right to be worried. I have seen nothing, but perhaps Mistress Munne can offer you some assistance. She is much more familiar with the catacombs than I.\"''\n\n\
  '''Necromancer Muune'''\n\
  :''\"Rurik is wise to suspect the Charr of moving through the catacombs. They are fraught with much danger, but if you were familiar with them they could lead you to almost any region in Ascalon. Seek out my associate Oberan the Reviled. He makes his home deep in the catacombs and will know if any Charr have ventured there.\"''\n\n\
  '''Oberan the Reviled'''\n\
  :''\"You come here seeking Charr? You were wise to seek out Oberan, for no creature, be they living or dead, moves through here without my knowledge. This Charr that you seek comes often to the underground, but he does not make his lair here. The spirits of this place would not tolerate him should he seek to take up residence. If you require proof of his presence, take this...it's a token he left behind during one of his encounters with the denizens of this place. Now then, leave me to my studies. Return to the world of light.\"''\n\n\
  ===Reward dialogue===\n\
  '''Prince Rurik'''\n\
  :''\"This is proof enough. You have served Ascalon well this day. I will mobilize the troops and search for this beast.\"''\n\n\
  ==Notes==\n\
  This is a good way to get to Oberan the Reviled for Necromancers to grab the skill quest [[The Accursed Path]], as this quest leads you straight to him."

  | effect = [[Quicksand (Effect)|Quicksand]]
  | map = [[Image:Nomads_Isle_map.jpg|200px|Nomad's Isle Map]]
  }}
  ===Layout===
  The '''Nomad's Isle''' [[Guild Hall]], introduced with the [[Prophecies]]-campaign, consists of two forts, north (defender) and south (attacker), as well as a sandy region between those, including a [[quicksand (environment effect)|quicksand]] area you must pass to take over the flagstand. The bases are also connected via a teleporter system. Other than the those at the [[Isle of Solitude]] these are two-way gates.
  
  ===Quicksand===
  The [[quicksand (environment effect)|quicksand]] slows your movement by 15% and gives you a loss of one Energy every time you attack or use a skill. Because of the movement penalty flagrunners are an easy target for [[projectile]] attacks from beneath the flagstand.
  
  ===Teleporter===
  Using the '''teleporter''' is a fast was to get into the enemy fort. Because of this Nomad's Isle is a good map for a [[gank]] or [[split]]. Teleporting nearly a half radar radius comes often surprisingly for your enemy and the near [[archer]] can be killed before they react.
  
  ===NPCs===
  *The [[archer]]s closest to the middle stand on higher ground and can be used as assistance while fighting in the [[quicksand (environment effect)|quicksand]]. Also an [[assassin]] can [[shadow step]] to them.
  *The [[archer]]s in the inner base can be easily attacked by skills without need of line of sight as they stand behind a wooden wall. This can also be used for a short retreat, as you do not have to get out of their attack [[range]] to be save from their [[projectile]]s.

  To raise your [[Sunspear rank]] you must gain Sunspear promotion points. You can earn these points by finishing certain quests and by killing monsters while under the effects of the appropriate [[bounty]]. These bounties are given by [[NPC]]s at [[resurrection shrine]]s and grant you double [[XP]] and varying amounts of Sunspear points (depending on the [[region]]) for each enemy you kill.\n\n\
  ==Notes==\n\
  *This title track is similar to the [[Lightbringer rank]] title track.\n\
  *Upon attaining the rank of Sunspear Commander (tier 6), your character can no longer obtain [[bounties]] on [[Istan]].\n\
  *Upon attaining the rank of Sunspear Castellan (tier 8), your character can no longer obtain bounties offered in [[normal mode]] (excluding the [[Domain of Anguish]]). You must play in [[hard mode]] to get bounties to earn the last two ranks.\n\
  *The last time you need to earn a Sunspear rank is in the quest \"And a Hero Shall Lead Them,\" where you need to attain the rank Sunspear General (2,500 Promotion Points), this requirement is only for [[Nightfall|Elonian]] characters, [[Prophecies|Tyrian]] & [[Factions|Canthan]] characters do not need to acquire this rank to progress the [[Nightfall]] [[campaign]].\n\
  *Sunspear skills' green numbers cover a rank range of 0...8.\n\

  [[Stance]]. Reduce damage from non-[[critical hit]]s by 1...30 based on the turtle's level.
  
  ==Notes==
  *This skill is used by many creatures of the [[Turtle]] species.
  *The damage reduction is equal to the creature's level. A level 23 [[Kappa]] will have all [[direct damage]] to it reduced by 23 points.
  *Note that this damage reduction takes place after calculating the damage reduction from the turtle's armor. In this respect, it acts like the monk spell [[Shielding Hands]].
  *Life stealing skills are effective, since life stealing does not count as damage.
  *[[Wild Blow]] will deliver a critical hit and remove the stance, dealing full damage in the process.
  *Assassins with a high [[Critical Strikes]] attribute can surpass this skill and kill a turtle relatively quickly.
  *Any [[condition]] or [[hex]] that causes [[health]] degeneration are also effective means of avoiding this defense.
  *Repetitive, low damage attacks will be less effective.  For instance, Warriors may wish to use [[hammer]]s instead of [[sword]]s.
  *The recharging mechanism is currently not known; some turtles have been observed to re-enter the stance quite quickly. The skill description shows no activation cost or recharge time, so it is possible that the skill may recharge instantly.

  '''Elder Rhea'''\n\
  :''\"You have proven yourself a capable and loyal ally of the Luxons, so it is with confidence that I impart on you this most vital mission. You have, of course, seen how important the great turtles are to us, both as beasts of burden and beasts of war. Unfortunately, a group of bandits have recently attacked one of our supply caravans and stolen a chest of turtle eggs before they could reach the hatchery. Our turtles are very rare, and it is not often that they lay eggs, so every single egg is precious to us. We must track the bandits back to their camp in the '''Maishang Hills''', recover the '''chest of turtle eggs''', and get them to the '''Gyala Hatchery''' before something happens to them. Can you do this for us, <player name>?\"''\n\
  :'''Accept:''' ''\"Hang on, little ones! I'll save you!\"''\n\
  :'''Decline:''' ''\"Have you ever tried pickled turtle eggs?\"''\n\
  :'''When asked about quest:''' ''\"I have heard that the bandits make their camp in '''Maishang Hills'''. They are sure to have the eggs there. Once you find them, get them back to '''Hatchery Keeper Gratian''' as quickly as you can.\"''\n\n\
  ===Reward dialogue===\n\
  '''Endre'''\n\
  :''\"So you are the ones coming along with us. Argo told me about you. You may have beaten the three clans at the Convocation, but I was not witness to it. Until I see you fight with my own eyes, your strength is nothing to me...Words on the wind. If we make it to the end of this alive, then your reputation with myself, and the rest of the Luxons, will be solid as this sea of jade.\"''\n\n\

  ==General==
  The [[Spined Aloe]] is generally a weak Monk. They're armor is extremely low and they're damage output isn't up to par either. They also have low HP. They can be annoying in numbers if you are killing solo as they can easily heal one another. Finding them in groups is quite common and more often than not, they will be in a group, rather than alone, using [[Heal Area]] and [[Orison of Healing]] to heal one another. Holy Wrath isn't a concern as they're HP is low enough that you won't be hitting them to many times.

  ==Usage Notes==
  *'''Arcane Echo''' can be used to copy powerful skills with long recharges, effectively doubling the rate at which they can be used.
  *Be mindful that using this skill can be very energy intensive. Most of the time, you will cast Arcane Echo, the skill to be copied, and Arcane Echo again in the form of the copied skill. The total cost would be 15 + 2(copied skill).
  *Using [[Auspicious Incantation]] before either this enchantment, or before the copied spell will net you energy gains without a drawback (since the disabled skill will be replaced shortly thereafter).
  *Use [[Echo]] to copy non-spell skills and reduce energy costs. Or [[echo chain]] both skills to have three copies of one skill at once.

  * It is important to note that while any spells cast directly on the target fail, the target can still be damaged by [[AoE]] (Area of Effect) damage targeted on a party member near you.
  * While this enchantment cannot be removed ''directly'' via spells, it can still be removed ''indirectly'' by non-targeted spells (like [[Chilblains]]).

  Assassinate the three members of the [[White Mantle]] inner council.  \n\n\
  ==Quest information==\n\n\
  ===Objectives===\n\
  * Kill Inner Council Member Argyle.\n\
  * Kill Inner Council Member Bolivar.\n\
  * Kill Inner Council Member Cuthbert.\n\
  * See Fogard Axemighty for your reward.\n\n\
  ===Reward===\n\
  * 500 [[Experience]]\n\n\
  ==Walkthrough==\n\
  Exit [[Ember Light Camp]] and proceed carefully around the island to the western coast of [[Perdition Rock]]. There are two choices here: heading directly west through large groups of enemies, or fighting one's way to the east and taking on smaller groups, then doubling back around to the center and heading west from there.\n\n\
  Either method involves fighting large numbers of [[Flesh Golem (Ring of Fire Islands)|Flesh Golem]]s, [[Phantom]]s, [[Mahgo Hydra]]s, and numerous bosses that spawn along the way. Enchantment removal and hexes are rampant in the entire area, as is hard-hitting [[Area of Effect]] damage, so the group should come prepared.\n\n\
  Directly to the north of the Ember Light Camp exit is a crossroads in the center of Perdition Rock. To the west of this crossroads is an Ether Seal that should be taken out as quickly as possible after clearing out the immediate area. [[Mursaat]] and some [[White Mantle]] are present here, but not in large numbers.\n\n\
  Fighting onward to the west either going to the north through a group of [[Breeze Keeper]]s or to the south through a large group of [[Pantom]]s, eventually the group will arrive at the docks which are guarded by two pull-able groups of White Mantle. The three members of the inner council are up above on a shrine and will engage only when a party member's aggro bubble touches them, so the group can safely clear the area before taking on the bosses.\n\n\
  After the fight, Speak to Captain Grumby who will escort the party directly to the [[Ring of Fire (outpost)|Ring of Fire]].\n\n\
  ==Dialogue==\n\n\
  ===Initial dialogue===\n\
  '''Shadow'''\n\
  :''\"Since Confessor Dorian's death, the White Mantle is like a snake without its head. It still writhes and strangles the peoples of Tyria, but it has no eyes with which to see, no teeth with which to bite. Unfortunately, they still have their so-called \"unseen\" masters to assist them.\"''\n\n\
  :''\"Members of the White Mantle's inner council are meeting with the Mursaat...in secret, or so they think. We need to get in there and take out all three members of the inner council. Think you can handle it?\"''\n\
  :'''Accept:''' ''\"I was born for this.\"''\n\
  :'''Decline:''' ''\"I don't think so.\"''\n\
  :'''When asked about quest:''' ''\"Kill all three members of the White Mantle inner council.\"''\n\n\
  ===Intermediate dialogue===\n\
  <!-- for dialogue in windows -->\n\
  '''Captain Grumby'''\n\
  :''\"Ahoy, there! I am Captain Grumby. Not that I am proud of it, but the Mantle pay the coin to keep my mouth shut and my boat docked unless they say otherwise.\"''\n\n\
  :''\"What can I help you with?\"''\n\n\
  :'''Take me to the Ring of Fire Island Chain.'''\n\n\
  :''\"I couldn't! The would burn my home and stuff my spirit in one of those evil statues!\"''\n\n\
  :'''Help us and we will make sure you aren't harmed.'''\n\n\
  :''\"Well you did just kill all three of the inner council without so much as breaking a sweat. You've changed my mind! I'll serve the White Mantle no longer! Let me know when you want to go.\"''\n\n\n\
  ===Reward dialogue===\n\
  '''Fogard Axemighty'''\n\
  :''\"Bravo! The White Mantle won't soon recover from a blow like that. Excellent work!\"''\n\n\
  ==Notes==\n\
  * Due to the number of [[Elite skill]]s available for capture in [[Perdition Rock]], it may be desirable and advantageous to plan heading east and going around the entire island to accomplish the mission. Each profession has at least two Elite skills that may be captured here."

  * Interrupted skills won't trigger the effect, since it is applied before skill activation.
  * The damage will be applied before divine healing bonus is applied, so 'heal all party' self targeted skills will keep a monk healed while healing the whole party.

  == Notes ==
  * This spell combines particularly well with the cheap fast casting skills from the [[Protection Prayers]] line.
  * Some form of energy management is strongly recommended if using this skill due to the reduced energy regeneration and increased spell cost.
  * Divine Boon does not trigger on skills which do not specify an ally which include skills like [[Heal Area]], [[Heal Party]] and Divine Boon itself.

  | type = Cooperative
  | requiredhero = Zhed Shadowhoof

  | preceded by = [[Crossing the Desolation]]
  | followed by = [[A Deal's a Deal]]
  }}
  This is a lengthy mission where you tame the [[Junundu Wurms]] to gain the ability to travel [[The Desolation]].
  
  ''Gate of Desolation'' has two parts, the first is the taming of the Junundu queen, [[Queen Aijundu]] by defeating her and her [[Undead]] helpers. The second is traveling the desolation guided by [[Palawa Joko]] safely ensconced in your very own controllable wurm escort.  
  
  ==Mission information==
  ===Requirements===
  Make sure you have [[Zhed Shadowhoof]] in your party before you enter this mission. 
  
  ===Objectives===
  Tame Queen Aijundu and gain control of the junundu wurms.
  * '''Added''' Defeat Queen Aijundu and her undead minions.
  * '''Added''' Call forth a junundu so you may ride it through the sulfur.
  * '''Added''' Guide the junundu to the [[Remains of Sahlahja]].
  * '''Bonus''' Protect the [[Junundu Young]] from the demon hordes. 
  
  ===Reward===
  The reward for this mission depends on how many Junundu young you rescue from the [[Margonite]]s.
  {{Mission reward
  | objective = Junundu saved
  | standard = 0 - 1
  | expert = 2
  | master = 3 }}
  
  ==Walkthrough==
  
  As you enter the mission [[Palawa Joko]] starts to talk and will lead you to a [[Wurm spoor]] to the left of the entrance.   The wurm spoor is situated in a hole beyond which the yellow sulfurous wastes begin.  To walk in human form on the areas which show as bright yellow on the map means near immediate death.  Stay clear.
  
  It is at this wurm spore(1 on the map) that you will tame [[Queen Aijundu]], so set up for the fight.  You should stage the fight from the hill over looking the wurm spoor which will give you a height advantage and keeps you away from the sulfur.  If you are using henchmen they should be pinned at the top of the hill at the point furthest from the sulfer and set to defensive mode.
  
  After a few groups of undead have attacked and been defeated, Queen Aijundu will approach and attack.  Once her health has been reduced a bit she will retreat and further undead will attack.  There are quite a few bosses who spawn in the undead groups - keep an eye out for them.  Aijundu will attack again when all the undead are killed, this time when you've damaged her enough she will allow you to use the wurms to cross the Desolation. Look out for enemies with [[hard res]]ses: [[Awakened Acolyte]]s, [[Awakened Cavalier]]s and especially the boss [[Chakeh The Lonely]]. Left alone these will resurrect fallen enemies on top of the new groups approaching you, which might overwhelm the party.
  
  Click on the wurm spoor.  This will summon wurms to transport you and the party.  You now have control of the wurm and will use [[wurm skills]] rather than those you have equipped on your character.  You can now travel on the sulfur areas without dying.
  
  Follow Palawa Joko as he leads you to the [[Remains of Sahlahja]].  Along the way you will fight groups of [[Margonite]]s and [[Elemental]]s.  Margonites are easy to take down in wurm form, but take care with the Elementals, especially the [[Sandstorm Crag]]s whose earth attacks prove dangerous to the wurms.  Remember to use [[Junundu Wail]] to resurrect fallen party members and heal once a fight is over.
  
  During the journey you will encounter rocky ground which the wurms cannot travel through.  You will have to abandon the wurm until you find another wurm spoor which will allow you to travel on the sulfur again.  By timing your movement, you can avoid the margonite group nearby and proceed to the next worm spoor. You complete the mission when you reach the Remains of Sahlahja.
  
  ===Bonus===
  The bonus takes some time to complete as finding the [[Junundu Young]] to rescue them results in detours from the direct route which Joko leads.  That said, the bonus is not difficult to complete.
  
  Each Junundu Young is surrounded by Margonites.  They do not attack the wurm, so they are safe.  However you can kill the young using your attack skills, particularly [[Junundu Smash]], so pull the Margonites away from the young just to be sure.  When the Margonites are killed and an advice box appears stating that the young is saved it no longer needs to be kept alive.  So when the young dies during later fights - Don't Panic - it still counts towards completing the bonus.
  
  It is easiest to save the young while you are in wurm form.  Since all young can be reached in worm form, there is no need to leave the worms after you have entered them for the second time till the very end of the mission.
  
  ===Skill recommendations===
  *Consider skills which deal [[Holy damage]] to quickly dispatch undead.

  }}
  There are many souls unjustly trapped in the [[Realm of Torment]] and they are used as a power source for [[Abaddon]].  The souls must be freed to weaken Abaddon for the fight to come.  
  
  Follow the left wall when you enter and kill the groups of [[Torment Demon]]s and [[Terrorweb Dryder]]s in your way.  When you reach the river of souls keep it to your left and keep going until you get to a bridge. Cross the bridge and walk around the structure in the middle killing any [[Tortureweb Dryder (boss)|Tortureweb Dryders]] you find, until all of the spirits are freed.
  
  ==Mission information==
  ===Requirements===
  [[Dunkoro]] must be in your party before you can enter. 
  
  ===Objectives===
  Find a way to release the tortured souls from the River of Souls.
  * '''Added''' Destroy the Emissary of Dhuum.
  * '''Added''' Kill Tortureweb Dryders to free the souls they captured from the River of Souls.
  * '''Bonus''' Kill the additional elite emissaries. 
  
  ===Reward===
  The mission reward depends on the number of Emissaries you seek out and destroy.
  {{Mission reward
  | objective = Emissaries destroyed
  | standard = 0 - 1
  | expert = 2
  | master = 3 }}
  
  ==Walkthrough==
  Make sure that you have Dunkoro in your party before you begin ''Gate of Pain''.
  
  Kormir follows you for this mission.  She doesn't take any damage so you don't need to worry about her.
  
  From where you spawn follow the left most option of the three tunnels presented to you.  Continue to follow the left wall until you reach the River of Souls.  Along the way there will be several groups of Torment Demons and several groups of two Terrorweb Dryers.  Put an interrupter on one of the Terrorwebs to stop the [[Meteor Shower]] and other spells while the rest of the group destroys the other one.  Also note that as the Terrorweb's are beasties from the Underworld [[Lightbringer's Gaze]] doesn't work on them.
  
  Once at the river go to the right until you get to a bridge over the souls.  On the other side is Tortureweb Dryder who will shortly be joined by an [[Emissary of Dhuum %28warrior%29|Emissary of Dhuum]], if you don't wait for the conversation between the [[Undead Lich]] and the Emissary of Dhuum to finish you have a good chance to destroy the Tortureweb before the Emissary arrives.  Torturewebs are [[elementalist]] bosses so do a large amount of damage so make sure you [[pre-prot]] before taking them on.  Another tip is to wait until they use the skill [[Soul Torture]] which takes a long time to cast, if you don't interrupt it you have a lengthy period of time to damage it while it is defenseless.
  
  Once the Emissary and Tortureweb are dead you are free to move around the structure in the middle destroying any Torturewebs which are imprisoning the souls you want to free.  The souls run off to a special location on the map before they're counted as freed - nothing attacks them so you don't need to worry about them.  When the last Tortureweb is dead, there are six in total, wait until all the souls reach their special location to finish the mission.
  
  ===Bonus===
  The bonus involves killing more Emissaries of Dhuum.  One is located in the middle of the structure you travel around to find the Torturewebs, the other two are back over the river of souls.  Each of these is easy enough to find while you are travelling to find the Torturewebs.  If you want to do the bonus leave a Tortureweb alive until you've killed all of the Emissaries.
  
  The Emissaries are each accompanied by three Terrorwebs.  Eliminate the Terrorwebs first and then turn your attention to the Emissary.
  
  ===Skill recommendations===
  *Bring plenty of spell interrupts such as [[Power Spike]] or [[Savage Shot]]
  *Damage reduction skills, such as [[Protective Spirit]] or [[Shelter]]

  :''\"All right, <name>, I was asked to see to it you learned what it means to be a Warrior. You've heard the stories no doubt: Warriors are impossible to kill, they are capable of incredible feats of endurance, and they are deadly in close combat.\"''\n\n\
  :''\"Listen to what I have to say, and you just might learn how to accomplish all these feats and more.\"''\n\n\
  '''[[Ranger]]: [[Artemis the Ranger]]\n\
  :''\"You must be the aspiring Ranger I was asked to meet. Alright then, let's get started. We'll begin by giving you some hands-on experience with your bow, but you should keep in mind that this profession requires a diverse skill set. As a Ranger, you'll have an opportunity to learn how to set traps, gain an animal companion, and use nature rituals to alter the entire battlefield. Believe you me, enemies will fear your combination of range, speed and toughness. Yes, it's good to be a Ranger.\"''\n\n\
  '''[[Monk]]: [[Ciglo the Monk]]'''\n\
  :''\"Sir Tydus sent you to meet me, yes? I am Ciglo the Monk. I use prayer to heal the wounded, use enchantments to shield my friends from harm, and call upon the power of the gods to smite the enemies of Ascalon. In time, perhaps, you too will learn to the do the same.\"''\n\n\
  '''[[Necromancer]]: [[Verata the Necromancer]]\n\
  :''\"Come closer. Look Verata in the eye. Yes, now you'll learn the true power of the dark. Whether animating the dead, siphoning the life energy of others, or using curses to confound your foes, as a Necromancer, it is you who will turn the tide of battle at the decisive moment. This I shall show you firsthand.\"''\n\n\
  '''[[Mesmer]]: [[Sebedoh the Mesmer]]'''\n\
  :''\"I was asked to meet you out here and share a few secrets about being a Mesmer. It is not an easy profession to grasp. The Mesmer is not a mage in the traditional sense. His strength lies not in the manipulation of the physical, but rather through influencing the minds of others. Though not overflowing with raw power, he is feared by spellcasters for his ability to disrupt their actions and by fighters for his many illusionary attacks that bypass physical defenses. Almost everything you do as a Mesmer is indirect, but that does not mean it is inconsequential. Fear not if you do not yet understand. You will.\"''\n\n\
  '''[[Elementalist]]: [[Howland the Elementalist]]'''\n\
  :''\"Are you the one Sir Tydus wished me to instruct? Good. Listen closely: An Elementalist manipulates the power of air, earth, fire, and water. Some choose to specialize in a single element, others learn to control more than one. This choice can vastly alter one's abilities, since each element has its own strengths and weaknesses. That's enough of a lecture. The rest of your lesson will be hands-on.\"''"

  Take the [[Scorched Lodestone]]s from the [[The Way of the Geomancer]] and bring them to three Earth Shrines.  Afterwards, destroy the summoned [[Stone Golem]].\n\n\
  ===Requirements===\n\
  * Must be have [[Elementalist]] as primary or secondary [[profession]].\n\n\
  ===Objectives===\n\
  * Activate all 3 earth shrines by placing [[Scorched Lodestone]]s upon them.\n\
  * Slay the summoned stone golem.\n\
  * Return to [[Kendrick Redstaff]] for your reward.\n\n\
  ===Reward===\n\
  * 500 [[Experience]]\n\
  * {{skill icon|Magnetic Aura}}\n\
  * {{skill icon|Earth Attunement}}\n\n\
  ==Walkthrough==\n\
  If you have 3 [[Scorched Lodestone]]s already from the [[The Way of the Geomancer]] - skip this paragraph.  The area outside of [[Serenity Temple]] is brimming with [[Stone Elemental]]s and [[Hulking Stone Elemental]]s.  Spend some time in the area until you receive the necessary 3 [[Scorched Lodestone]]s.  \n\n\
  Now, travel through the [[Pockmark Flats]] to the earth shrines.  Be careful of stone elemental patrols, there are a lot of patrols and they seem to converge at the earth shrines.  Each earth shrine will look like a stone with an inscription and a bowl on the top.  When a [[Scorched Lodestone]] is place in each shrine a yellow sphere will glow above the shrine.  \n\n\
  Each earth shrine can be found in relation to the massive crater in the northern part of the [[Pockmark Flats]].  The first earth shrine is north of the crater, the second shrine is to the west of the crater, and the third shrine is south of the crater.\n\n\
  After all three shrines have a [[Scorched Lodestone]] placed within them the [[Stone Golem]] will appear to the southeast of the crater.  The [[Stone Golem]] spawns by itself, but there are several earth elemental patrols around its position.  [[Stone Golem]] can be seen from the souther earth shrine.\n\n\
  ==Dialogue==\n\n\
  ===Initial Dialogue===\n\
  :'''[[Kendrick Redstaff]]'''\n\
  :''\"Now then, you may have defeated these lesser elementals, but that was just a preliminary test.  Take 3 [[scorched lodestone]]s to the earth shrines located around the massive crystal in [[pockmark flats]].  This will summon a large [[stone golem]].  Defeat the golem, and I will teach you some of the secrets of the earth.  If you fail, don't bother returning to me.  \n\n\
  :Will you accept this challenge?\"''\n\
  :'''Accept:'''  ''\"It will hardly be a challenge.\"''\n\
  :'''Decline:''' ''\"I don't like your attitude.\"''\n\
  :'''When asked about quest:''' ''\"I though I was clear enough before.  How can I make this more simple?  You find [[scorched lodestone]]s on earth elementals.  You take them to the 3 earth shrines.  You kill the summoned [[stone golem]].  You come talk  to me when you're all done.\"''\n\n\
  === Reward Dialogue===\n\
  '''[[Kendrick Redstaff]]'''\n\
  :''\"So, you managed to take down the golem after all.  Well, I suppose it wasn't the worst attempt that I've ever seen.  Very well , I'll teach you something about earth magic.\"''\n\n\

  ==Quest iinformation==\n\
  ===Requirements===\n\
  * A [[Prophecies]] character.\n\n\
  ===Objectives===\n\
  * Find [[Farmer Dirk]]'s last remaining [[Prize-Winning Hog]] and chase it back to him.\n\
  * Return to Farmer Dirk for your reward.\n\n\

  ==Walkthrough==\n\n\
  When you got the quest of the farmer, you have to walk a little back to the southeast. The prize winning hog will be there. About half-way along the return journey two sets of two level 15 [[Gypsie Ettin]]s will appear. When those are dead you have to \"bump\" the hog in the direction of the farmer, it will not follow you. When it gets stuck against a wall, take a bit of distance, it will start walking and you can bump it again. When you arrive at the farmer in this way the quest will be ready. You don't have to get the hog into the pen.\n\n\
  ==Dialogue==\n\
  ===Initial Dialogue===\n\
  '''Farmer Dirk'''\n\
  :\"''I recognize you! You're <player name>, the one who got us through the mountains. If you have the time, I sure would appreciate it if you could help me with a problem. My last '''prize-winning hog''' has run off! He was heading south, but I'm afraid to go after him with all the ettins and those bird men about. He might be a little skittish, so you'll probably have to chase him back here.\n\n\
  :''Will you retrieve my prize-winning hog for me?\"''\n\n\
  :'''Accept''' \"''Why not, I've nothing else to do.\"''\n\
  :'''Decline''' \"''That's beneath me.\"''\n\
  :'''When asked about quest''' \"''Please chase my '''prize-winning hog''' back here. He's probably south of here and half scared out of his mind.\"''\n\n\
  ===Reward Dialogue===\n\
  '''Farmer Dirk'''\n\
  :\"''Thank you, <player name>! I'll never forget this. After losing half of my hogs in the Searing and the other half being turned into bacon for the journey through those mountains, I was worried sick that I'd lose this last little guy.\"''"

  [[Olias]] is a [[hero]] available in [[Guild Wars Nightfall]] that can only be recruited if the player has a linked [[Guild Wars Prophecies]] account. He is a former [[White Mantle]] who, after an encounter in the [[Temple of the Ages]], was converted to the worship of [[Grenth]]. He came to [[Elona]] to help fight the [[Abaddon|outcast god]] that threatens to rise again and challenge Grenth's reign over the realm of the dead.\n\n\
  From the manual:\n\
  :''Obsessed Necromancer''\n\
  ::''\"Grenth lives! You, on the other hand, must die!\"''\n\n\
  :'''Origin:''' [[Tyria]]n ([[Lion's Arch]])<br>\n\
  :'''Age:''' 32<br>\n\
  :'''Profession:''' [[Necromancer]]\n\
  :''Olias used to take his marching orders from the White Mantle, but he now walks his own path. An encounter at the Temple of Ages convinced Olias that he had been chosen for a special mission: he now serves as Grenth's personal \"hand of judgment,\" enacting what he sees as the will of his god. He lives by a simple code. Those who perish and return to life are expected by Grenth to live their lives well. If they do not, Olias ensures they are returned to the cold embrace of the Lord of Death.''\n\n\
  :''Mysterious events in Elona now compel him to act on Grenth's behalf. With strange disturbances in the land, Olias feels that the gods are threatened and the dead themselves are uneasy in their eternal sleep. He has sworn an oath to Grenth that he will find the source of the strange malady and correct it. And if it involves sending new minions to Grenth, so much the better! Death and killing delight him. He is willing to discuss other matters, but strangely enough, most discussions seem to lead back to death and killing.''\n\n\

  The appearance of his armor can be upgraded to [[Ancient armor]] using [[Mysterious Armor Piece]]s acquired from the [[the Shadow Nexus]] [[Challenge Mission]]. \n\n\
  The appearance of his armor can be upgraded to [[Primeval armor]] using [[Primeval Armor Remnants]] acquired in the [[Domain of Anguish]] and during [[the Ebony Citadel of Mallyx]] mission.\n\n\

  ==Quest information==\n\
  ===Objectives===\n\
  *Enter the [[Jade Arena|arena]] and defeat all of the other combatants.\n\
  *See Arena Master Portus for your reward.\n\n\
  ===Reward===\n\
  *2000 [[Experience]]\n\
  *400 [[Luxon faction|Luxon Faction]]\n\
  *150 [[Gold]]\n\n\
  ==Walkthrough==\n\
  Starting from Breaker Hollow, walk south along the west wall onto a small hill and soon you will be able to meet Arena Master Portus. There is usually a wandering group near the small hill consisting of one to two [[Creeping Carp]](s),a [[Irukandji]] and [[Scuttle Fish]] and a group of three to four [[Oni]]s that will spawn at the top of the small hill just before meeting with Portus.\n\n\
  '''Alternate route''': With 7 people with the assassin skill [[Recall]] casted on a runner with the runner starting from [[Jade Flats (Luxon)|Jade Flats]], this quest can be completed less than 2 minutes per run since the enemies near Jade Flats do not possible a slow down skill such as [[Siphon Speed]] and the mobs can be avoided to save time.\n\n\
  ==Dialogues==\n\
  ===Initial dialogue===\n\
  '''Arena Master Portus'''\n\
  :''\"Inside this arena, I have gathered together a team of [[Convicted Criminal|convicted criminals]], who will face you in combat. To heighten the challenge and provide greater entertainment for those who've come to watch the battle, I will also let loose upon you some of the fierce [[creature]]s I have captured from across [[the Jade Sea]]. Are you a coward, or will you enter the arena and face this challenge?\"''\n\n\
  :'''Accept:''' ''\"Let the battle commence!\"''\n\
  :'''Decline:''' ''\"I'm a coward.\"''\n\
  :'''When asked about quest:''' ''\"Many have traveled a great distance to watch this battle. Don't let them down. Get in the '''arena''' and defeat those I've set against you.\"''\n\n\
  ===Intermediate dialogue===\n\
  '''Arena Master Portus'''\n\
  :''\"Greetings [[Luxon]]s. Many of you have travelled great distances to be here today, and you shall not go away disappointed. That I promise you!\"''\n\
  :''\"For today, I have the great pleasure of bringing you a battle featuring the mighty champions who claimed victory at the Convocation!\"''\n\
  :''\"They shall face a team of criminals who were convicted to battle in the arena for crimes too unspeakable and unsavory to mention aloud.\"''\n\
  :''\"For your entertainment, some of the creatures I have captured from across the vast expanses of the sea might also make a special appearance in the arena today!\"''\n\
  :''\"I know you are all eager for the show, so without further talk... Let the battle begin!\"''\n\n\
  ===Reward dialogue===\n\
  '''Arena Master Portus'''\n\
  :''\"Did you hear the roar of that crowd?  They loved you out there!  This battle was great for business.  Any time you want to come back and sharpen your skills in the arena, let me know.  I'll give you top billing.\"''\n\n\
  ==Known teams==\n\
  *2 [[Convicted Criminal (Warrior)|Warriors]], 2 [[Convicted Criminal (Monk)|Monks]], 1 [[Convicted Criminal (Necromancer)|Necromancer]], 2 [[Convicted Criminal (Assassin)|Assassins]], 1 [[Convicted Criminal (Ritualist)|Ritualist]], no monsters.\n\
  *3 [[Convicted Criminal (Ranger)|Rangers]], 2 [[Convicted Criminal (Monk)|Monks]], 3 [[Convicted Criminal (Elementalist)|Elementalists]], no monsters.\n\
  *1 [[Irukandji]], 1 [[Convicted Criminal (Warrior)|Warrior]], 1 [[Convicted Criminal (Ranger)|Ranger]], 2 [[Convicted Criminal (Monk)|Monks]], 1 [[Convicted Criminal (Necromancer)|Necromancer]], 1 [[Convicted Criminal (Mesmer)|Mesmer]], 1 [[Convicted Criminal (Elementalist)|Elementalist]].\n\
  *1 [[Irukandji]], 3 [[Convicted Criminal (Ranger)|Rangers]], 2 [[Convicted Criminal (Monk)|Monks]], 2 [[Convicted Criminal (Elementalist)|Elementalists]].\n\
  *1 [[Jade Torn Kirin]], 2 [[Convicted Criminal (Ranger)|Rangers]], 2 [[Convicted Criminal (Monk)|Monks]], 2 [[Convicted Criminal (Mesmer)|Mesmers]], 1 [[Convicted Criminal (Elementalist)|Elementalist]].\n\n\
  ==Notes==\n\
  *The professions of the criminals can be identified by their appearance. \n\
  *The Kurzick equivalent to this quests is [[Duel of the Houses]].\n\
  *This is a wonderful way to [[faction farm]] Luxon faction, make some money, and gain experience for the [[survivor]] [[title]] and skill points. It is recommended to do this quest when alliance's battles map are not in favor for the Luxons ([[Grenz Frontier]] & [[The Ancestral Lands]])\n\
  *It is advised to bring skills that prevent [[resurrection]] through the use of interrupts or the skill [[Frozen Soil]]. If the team does not have Frozen Soil, use [[Primal Echoes]] as an alternate.\n\
  *By using an efficient team and [[Frozen Soil]], a player could use only heroes and henchmen to complete this quest in under three minutes  (including time to travel to [[Breaker Hollow]]) against most of the teams. If the [[Blessing of the Luxons]] from the priest near the entrance to Breaker Hollow, you would gain an additional 70-80 faction (from killing 14-16 enemies between the [[Oni]]s, the wandering group, and the [[Convicted Criminal]]s) for a mere 100 gold - which is reimbursed by the 150 gold reward from the quest.  This yields at least 475 faction every 5 minutes - allowing for 9500 faction per hour on average:\n\
  :{| {{STDT}} align=\"center\"\n\

  [[Norgu]] is a [[mesmer]] [[hero]] available in [[Guild Wars Nightfall]]. An actor who never met an adventure (or a buffet table) he didn't like.\n\n\
  He is an actor of the [[Lyssan Fools]] acting troupe and once a bodyguard in the employ of [[Prince Bokka the Magnificent]].\n\n\
  From the [http://www.guildwars.com/theworld/heroes/ official website]:\n\
  :''Struggling Artist''\n\
  ::''\"Fame is fleeting, but a good meal will keep you going for days. You want that roll?\"''\n\n\
  :'''Origin:''' [[Vabbi]]\n\
  :'''Age:''' 24\n\
  :'''Profession:''' [[Mesmer]]/Actor\n\n\
  :''Norgu is a classically trained actor, a visionary unappreciated in his own time, and a large, dramatic, boisterous glad-hander. As the leader of the Lyssan Fools acting troupe, he is currently on an extended tour of the estates of [[Vabbi]]an nobles. Everywhere he travels, he leaves a memorable impression\xE2\x80\x93such as his insightfully accurate and delightfully humorous parody of [[General Bayel]] in Gundara,'' {{sic}} ''a performance that should keep him on an extended tour for quite some time. Norgu claims to have traveled throughout [[Tyria]] and [[Cantha]], including a standing-room-only performance at the [[Henge of Denravi]]. Moving quickly from one region to the next, he uses his sunny disposition and personal charisma to get last-minute invites to parties, audiences with the rich and powerful, and of course, free food. Norgu never met a buffet he didn't like. As long as the supplies hold out, Norgu can be a loyal and clever ally \xE2\x80\x93 and he's egotistical enough to make sure you never, ever forget that.''\n\n\
  From the manual:\n\

Few will forget his insightfully accurate and delightfully humorous parody of General Bayel in [[Gandara]], a performance that should keep him on an extended tour for quite some time.

  Investigate the ruins of [[Fahranur, The First City]] with [[Kormir]] to find what is killing the workers. Remember to have Melonni in your party. 
  
  ==Mission information==
  ===Requirements===
  *You must have reached [[Sunspear Rank]] of Second Spear to be able to enter the mission.
  *You must have Melonni in your party to enter this mission.
  
  ===Objectives===
  Travel to the ancient Istani ruins. [[Kormir]] must survive.
  * '''Added''' Obtain the tablet from [[Darehk]] and place it on the stone pedestal.
  * '''Added''' Place the two tablets on the pedestals.
  * '''Added''' Guard [[Kahdash]] while he places the tablet on the pedestal.
  * '''Added''' Find and defeat the [[Apocrypha]].
  * '''Bonus''' Do not harm any more [[Sunspear Ghost]]s.
  
  ===Reward===
  In this mission, the rewards are based on how many additional Sunspear Ghosts are alive at the end of the mission.
  {{Mission reward
  | objective = Ghosts alive
  | standard = 0
  | expert = 1
  | master = 2 }}
  
  ==Walkthrough==
  
  Begin this mission by making your way to the first gate. On the other side is a stomper. In best Indiana Jones style, time your run through this stomper to avoid being crushed to death. Safely through, you encounter a ghost, [[Darehk]], carrying a tablet. Kill the ghost and put the tablet on the stone pedestal in this area. This opens the next area of the city for you to enter. Darehk will start running away from you as soon as he spots you. If you are unable to cripple and kill him fast, ignore him and deal with the other undead in the area first to avoid being overwhelmed.
  
  The next area has two tablets which have to be retrieved and put on the pedestals to open its gate .You have to be careful of the fire and crippling traps set in the walls which go off periodically in this area. Kormir can die from standing in one, ending the mission.  If you place one of the stone tablets on the pedestal and take too long putting the other tablet on its pedestal, then a ghost will come, steal it take it back to where you first picked it up. Either carry the first tablet till you gain the second one or put the tablet on the floor by the pedestal while you retrieve the other if you are trying to do this mission alone. Carry and place both tablets on their pedestals to move on to the next area.   
  
  In the next area, a ghost named [[Kahdash]] holds a tablet, but he will carry it to the pedestal for you. Because he moves slowly as he does this, race ahead of him and kill the undead in his way so he doesn't come to harm. Eventually he will put the tablet on the pedestal, which will let you through to the final area of the mission.
  
  Kill the undead in this area as you head down the steps to the location where Apocrypha, the final boss, resides. Apocrypha changes professions periodically and must be killed to complete the mission. In its Dervish form, Apocrypha can deal a fair amount of damage to characters in melee range, in such a case, it is best to stay spread out.
  
  ===Bonus===
  To get the bonus, in the area in which you have to place two tablets to access the next section of the mission, there will be two [[Sunspear Ghost]]s who will consistently try to steal these two tablets from their pedastals and return them to where you first retrieved them - they must not be killed. To do this, grab both tablets and place them at the foot of the pedestals, and only place them on top of the pedestals once you have both of them close by. This will give you enough time to place the second tablet onto its pedestal before the sunspear ghost comes to take the first one away. The ghosts will attack you while you are retrieving the tablets, but don't fight back (all undead that are not Sunspear Ghosts are safe to kill), instead, run away from them. If you bring high level heroes, it will be easier to command them to [[Heroes#Combat Modes|avoid combat]]. Kormir will also attack the ghosts if she is within range, but she usually follows closely with your party, so pulling her away should not be too difficult. The bonus will be awarded once the entire mission is completed.
  
  ===Skill recommendations===
  *Consider bringing a [[Snare (tactic)|snare]] to stop the first ghost from running away.
  *Consider bringing skills that deal [[holy damage]]. [[Heart of Holy Flame]] is a good skill to put on the required hero [[Melonni]].
  
  ===Hard Mode===
  Jokanur Diggins is generally considered one of the harder Elonian missions to complete in [[Hard Mode]].  The increased difficulty, relative to the introductory mission [[Chahbek Village]], combined with the small party size of four make this mission a challenge.  Many players have not used Melonni much beyond this point and find it restrictive that you are required to bring her.  There are several things to consider when assembling a team for this mission.
  
  *There is plenty of damage to be handled.  Just one monk will likely not be enough to handle all the damage dealt out in this mission.  The [[Preying Lance]]s at the beginning of the mission are particularly dangerous, as are the [[Restless Dead]] who cast Deathly Swarm repeatedly.  To deal with this damage it is recommended that you bring the following:
  **Either a bonder monk, or a support ritualist (preferably a [[Ritual Lord]] spirit spammer.
  **Some way to shut down casters (a ranger with [[Broad Head Arrow]] works wonders here).
  **Either a way to shut down melee attackers ([[Weakness]], [[Blind]], [[Ward Against Melee]], etc.), or a way to punish melee attackers ([[Spiteful Spirit]], [[Empathy]], [[Reckless Haste]], [[Price of Failure]], [[Insidious Parasite]], etc).
  **A healer of some kind.
  *You must bring [[Melonni]].  This limits your party selection to whatever profession you are, a Dervish, and two optional heroes/henchmen/players.  This makes building a balanced party rather difficult, especially if you do not have a lot of Dervish skills unlocked.  If you absolutely cannot set up Melonni with good Dervish skills, then consider changing her secondary profession so that she can fill a role mentioned above.  Force her into whatever role fits your party best, even if she cannot do it as well as another profession.
  
  With these tips in mind, you should be able to prevent enough damage that your party will easily deal out more than anything you are facing.  Careful planning is required as you move through the mission and take care to remember that the undead respawn after a relatively short time, so don't stay in one spot too long to recover.

  * Migraine is especially useful in [[PvP]] to force a [[caster]] to make a choice between casting with an extended activation time, risking being interrupted, or not casting at all to avoid any effects interrupts may impose.
  * The weaker non-elite form of this hex, [[Arcane Conundrum]] doesn't cause health degeneration and, used alone, cannot be kept up indefinitely due to a shorter duration and longer recharge.
  * Extremely useful for providing a large window of opportunity for interrupting Monk spells, most of which normally have very short activation times.
  *Also useful in [[PvE]] [[Hard Mode]] to counter the native faster casting time of monsters.

  | region = Vabbi
  | type = Cooperative
  | partysize = 1
  | duration = Medium
  | preceded by = [[Rally The Princes]]
  | followed by = [[All's Well That Ends Well]]
  }}
  The priestess [[Kehanni]] has given you an invitation to the [[Garden of Seborhin]] for the [[Festival of Lyss]] which the three [[Vabbi]] princes are known to be attending.  In this mission you must perform tasks around the festival to convince each of the princes you are worth talking to and try to convince them that they should side with [[Istan]] and the [[Sunspears]] against [[Varesh]] and Kourna.
  
  ==Mission information==
  ===Requirements===
  You must enter this mission alone.
  
  ===Objectives===
  Convince the three [[Princes of Vabbi]] to join the fight against [[Varesh]].
  *Recruit [[Prince Mehtu the Wise]] for your war against Varesh.
  *Persuade [[Prince Bokka the Magnificent]] to join the [[Sunspears]] in the struggle against Warmarshal Varesh.
  *Coerce [[Prince Ahmtur the Mighty]] to ally against Warmarshal Varesh.
  *Prince Ahmtur the Mighty wishes to speak with you again.  Find out what he has to say.
  Defend the garden and its guests by slaying the harpies.
  *'''Bonus''' Participate in the [[Festival of Lyss]].
  
  ===Reward===
  The reward received depends on how many of the festival activites you participate in
  {{Mission reward
  | objective = Festival activities
  | standard = 0 - 3
  | expert = 4
  | master = 5 }}
  
  Standard = 1,000 experience, 100 gold and 1 skill point 
  
  Expert   = 1,500 experience, 150 gold and 1 skill point
  
  Master   = 2,000 experience, 200 gold and 1 skill point
  
  == Walkthrough ==
  
  You enter this mission alone and for the most part the mission involves mini games which don't necessarily involve any fighting.  The aim of the mission is to try and convince the Vabbi princes they should join your side in the fight against Varesh.  However to even get an audience with them you have to perform various tasks around the festival.  These tasks also contribute to the bonus, so by completing only the main quest you will get at least the expert reward.
  
  The fastest way to complete the mission is to complete the tasks necessary to talk to the princes before going and talking to the princes.  The required tasks or festival activities are as follows;
  
  #Teach [[Dende]] (for female characters) or [[Mina]] (for male characters) to dance.
  #Defeat [["Palawa Joko"]] in the re-enactment of the [[Battle of Jahai]].
  #Provide Bokka the Magnificent the gift of a [[Rare Antique Elonian Vase]] or cash.
  #*The Rare Antique Elonian Vase can be obtained from Jejumba in three ways.
  #*#By buying it from her for 4 platinum.
  #*#By fighting her.
  #*#By obtaining a [[Golden Phoenix Feather]]. The Golden Phoenix Feather is obtained by defeating the [[Royal Guard Captain]].
  
  You can then talk to each of the three princes. Return to [[Prince Ahmtur the Mighty]] for a second talk and a cinematic will start and harpies will attack.  2 Palace Guards and 2 Vabbi Guard Captains will join your party as allies for the Harpy attack and follow closely behind your character. Use your allies to dispatch of the harpies to complete the mission. If you are a necromancer summoning undead minions is quite helpful.
  
  Finishing masters in this mission in hardmode is extremely easy with most of the NPC's being beefed up in damage, armor, and level.
  
  ===Bonus===
  There are five festival activities which you participate in to complete the Master level for this mission. Some will already have been done in order to speak to the princes. All five are listed below:
  
  #Beat [[Zilo the Drunkard]] in a drinking contest. You can take drinks from [[Vabbi Noble]]s, [[Horticulturist Hinon]], [[Dual Master Lumbo]], [["Palawa Joko"]] and [[The Great Zehtuka]], however stealing Zehtuka's drink will cause him to turn aggressive. This contest can be repeated.
  #*This does not increase your Drunkard title track.
  #Defeat [[Lumo the Mime]] in a mime duel. This contest can be repeated.
  #*This is done by copying each of Lumo the Mime's next 10 [[emote]]s within several seconds.
  #*Lumo uses the same emote animations as a male Ranger.
  #*Lumo's dialogue incorrectly states that you must copy 15 emotes.
  #*Using the wrong emote will not cause you to lose the duel as long as you also use the correct emote within the allotted time. If you aren't sure about an emote, you can try to use several emotes which you suspect may be correct.
  # Speak to Duel Master Lumbo and take part in a reenactment of Turai Ossa's victory over Palawa Joko.
  #*Palawa Joko is very easy to beat. He is a a level 20 Necromancer who only uses Life Siphon, Blood of the Aggressor, and Dark Pact.
  #*It is possible to start this activity so that Palawa Joko turns hostile, but then leave him. Later on, when the skree are attacking, use the added help of a few guards to kill him (if you were having trouble on your own). You will still receive the bonus.
  #Obtain a Rare Antique Elonian Vase from Jejumba as a gift for Prince Bokka the Magnificent. Once obtained, present the vase to Royal Finance Minister Oloda. There are several ways to obtain the vase:
  #*Kill Jejumba and take the item (very easy).
  #*Pay 4 platinum for the item.
  #*Defeat the Royal Guard Captain towards the east end of the garden in a 1-on-1 duel to obtain a Golden Phoenix Feather. Trade this with Jejumba for the vase.
  #Teach the little boy, Dende, or the little girl, Mina, to dance. Speak to one of them, then speak to the other and quickly use the /dance emote. Then they will dance together.

  [[Eve]] hasn\xE2\x80\x99t a clue where she was born \xE2\x80\x94 she was found as a young child stealing food from a sleeping vagrant in the back alleys of [[Ascalon City]]. Fortunately for Eve, she was not found by a city guard but by a kindly matron, who brought her to the [[Holy Dwayna Academy for Wayward & Incorrigible Girls]] (Ascalon City branch). Wherever Eve had come from, she had already learned to read at an advanced level before she ended up at the school students called the \xE2\x80\x9CWayward Academy,\xE2\x80\x9D and voraciously devoured every text in the library. It wasn\xE2\x80\x99t long before Eve\xE2\x80\x99s curiosity (and her ability to both manipulate and avoid [[Matron Irma]]) led her to a secret library in the bowels of the Academy. There, forbidden texts opened up an entirely new world to young Eve. By the time she was 15, she had raised her first bone minion.\n\n\
  Eve had never gotten along with the other girls\xE2\x80\x94she much preferred the company of her tomes and scrolls. When, one day, a few of her fellow students pulled an especially vicious and humiliating prank on her, Eve literally pounced upon the leader of her tormentors, bit the girl\xE2\x80\x99s ear off, and swallowed it whole. That was the end of Eve\xE2\x80\x99s studies at the Holy Dwayna Academy for Wayward & Incorrigible Girls, and not even Matron Irma mourned her departure. She is one of the [[Heroes of Ascalon]]\n\n\
  Eve met [[Mhenlo]], [[Cynn]], [[Devona]], and [[Aidan]] during the [[Charr]] invasion. She was in the graveyard, experimenting with new methods of [[undead]] resurrection, when the Charr flooded into the cemetery on the heels of Mhenlo and the others. More out of curiosity than any noble intentions, Eve ordered the Charr to stop. When the beastly creatures turned on her instead, thinking her easy prey, she simply raised her hands and called forth a small army of the dead to meet them. The Charr never stood a chance. Eve was amused when Devona asked the [[Necromancer]] to join them, but has since become a good friend of Devona, Aidan, and Mhenlo. She is often in conflict with Cynn, but the two respect each other\xE2\x80\x99s power enough to get along when the going gets rough. \n\n\
  Of all Mhenlo\xE2\x80\x99s friends, Eve is probably the most independent, and it would not take much for the Necromancer to leave them behind and strike out on her own. But she is smart enough to know that loyal allies\xE2\x80\x94even the living\xE2\x80\x94are valuable to one with her powers. She has joined the expedition to [[Cantha]] to learn new ways to manipulate the powers of necromancy, and, she freely admits, to see what kinds of horrors might be created from Cantha\xE2\x80\x99s unique species. Eve\xE2\x80\x99s one constant companion is a human skull she found in the hidden library. She insists that the skull\xE2\x80\x94which she calls \xE2\x80\x9C[[Adam]]\xE2\x80\x9D\xE2\x80\x94speaks to her and dispenses wise advice at critical junctures. No one else has ever heard the skull say a word.\n\n\

  }}
  After rescuing Sunspears captured and imprisioned by the Kournan forces it becomes important to evacuate them to the relative safety of Istan and get news of the rout to the Istani Council.  
  
  In this mission, you and [[Koss]] escort the Sunspear troops to the coast while trying avoid the attention of the Kournan defenses in the area.
  
  ==Mission information==
  ===Requirements===
  Make sure that you have Koss in your party before entering the mission.
  
  ===Objectives===
  Lead the Sunspear Evacuees to Dajkah Inlet without being discovered by the [[Morzek Garrison|garrison]].
  *Kill all the guards at the garrison posts before they sound an alert and blow your cover.
  *Disarm the [[Sentry trap]]s before they discharge.
  *Start negotiations with [[Margrid the Sly]].
  *'''Bonus''' Neutralize all guard posts. 
  
  ===Reward===
  The reward for this mission depends on how many of the 12 guard posts in the area you neutralise.
  {{Mission reward
  | objective = Guard posts neutralised
  | standard = 0 - 7
  | expert = 8 - 11
  | master = 12 }}
  
  ==Walkthrough==
  
  Your task is simple, take the 8 Sunspear Evacuees across the zone to the coast where they can be evacuated while avoiding, or removing the threats on the way.  Each of the evacuees is a monk so they can look after themselves - don't concern yourself too much with looking after them as you travel.  The area is littered with Kournan military patrols but in addition to them there are three other aspects of this map you need to be aware of before you charge through; [[Sentry trap]]s, Guard posts and the Garrison.
  
  [[Sentry trap]]s dot the area and appear as a cone poking from the ground.  As you approach an activation timer appears giving a limited time to disarm it, using the Disarm Trap skill. If it activates it inflicts 100 damage to all allies in the area.  The Kournan Bowmen have interrupts which can prevent the trap from being disarmed, so if possible have several members accept this skill from [[Rojis]] before starting through the area in case of this eventuality.
  
  12 guard posts are located over the area.  Approaching one begins a timer to when siege attacks begin at the location. The meters come in various colors which indicate differences in how quickly the timer completes. From fastest to slowest, the meters are red, blue, teal, green and grey. Killing all the guards at the post prevents the sieges from occuring or stops them.
  
  There are troops stationed in Morzek Garrison, the fort in the middle of the area.  Approaching too close prompts a warning that you are too close.  Continue to approach and your team will be wiped and you will have to start the mission over.
  
  If you aren't doing the bonus the simplest route, with the least troops and smallest possibility of siege attack, is to go directly to the north-west corner of the map following the north wall of the area. Go south when you can go west no further until you find [[Margrid the Sly]].  Talk to Margrid to complete the mission.
  
  ===Bonus===
  The bonus is straight-forward but time consuming to complete.
  
  Use the [[area map]] to help you complete the mission.  Each of the 12 guard posts is marked on the map with a red flag, the garrison marked with red doors.  Make your way to each of the guard posts and kill the guards there to neutralize it.  This will turn the flag grey on the area map.  Whether you neutralize the guard post before or after the siege attacks start does not affect the bonus.
  
  ===Skill recommendations===
  *At least one team member needs to have room for [[Disarm Trap]] skill given in mission.
  *A Mesmer with a substantial investment in [[Domination Magic]] may cause enormous amounts of damage on guard posts with [[Spiritual Pain]] as each post generally has at least one [[Spirit of Infuriating Heat]].  Combined with an energy management skill such as [[Glyph of Lesser Energy]] a lone mesmer may eliminate almost all of the guards before your melee attackers can engage.

  ==Acquisition==\n\
  Simply acquiring an elite skill will contribute to the appropriate title track. Prior to the Nightfall campaign and later, the hard mode update, the only way to acquire an elite skill is to capture it using a [[Signet of Capture]]. In the Nightfall campaign, there is a special [[PvE]]-only elite that can be obtained via the [[Lightbringer rank]] (see notes below). The introduction of [[Elite Skill Tome]]s now allows characters to acquire elite skills that have already been unlocked.\n\n\
  ==Notes==\n\
  *Currently, there are 292 [[elite skill]]s in the game. All except 1 ([[Junundu Siege]]) count towards one or more Skill Hunter titles.\n\
  *Campaign-specific elites count towards that continent's title only.  There are 60 Prophecies-only elites to be captured in Tyria, 90 Factions-only elites in Cantha, and 111 Nightfall-only elites (including [[Lightbringer Signet]]) in Elona.\n\
  *The Lightbringer Signet counts towards the Elonian Skill Hunter track, but it is not obtained through the use of a [[Signet of Capture]]. It is the reward for obtaining the [[Lightbringer rank|Brave Lightbringer]] title. When the character collects the reward, the count for the number of elite skills in this title track is not updated until the next capture. If you are working toward the Elonian Skill Hunter title, it must not be the last Elonian elite you learn.\n\
  *Before the hard mode update, there was only one Skill Hunter title track, progressing from Skill Hunter &rarr; Adept Skill Hunter &rarr; Advanced Skill Hunter &rarr; Elite Skill Hunter &rarr; Expert Skill Hunter &rarr; Master Skill Hunter."

  }}
  ==Mission information==
  
  ===Requirements===
  Make sure that you have [[Koss]] in your party before entering this mission.
  
  ===Objectives===
  Save Chahbek Village:
  * Destroy the corsairs occupying the village.
  * Sink the corsair ship on the north side of the village.
  * Sink the corsair ship on the south side of the village.
  * '''Bonus''' Keep as many Sunspear Recruits alive as possible.
  
  ===Reward===
  The reward for this mission depends on how many Sunspear Recruits are still alive at the end.
  {{Mission reward
  | objective = Surviving recruits
  | standard = 0 - 1
  | expert =  2 
  | master =  3 }}
  Note that because this is a tutorial mission, the rewards for this mission are of smaller quantities than for other missions.  The rewards in this mission are:

  |-
  ! style="background-color:#7BC;" | Master's
  |1000||100||1
  |}
  
  ==Walkthrough==
  
  For this mission you have to kill all of the [[corsair]]s in the village, including those on the boats to the edge of the map.  The most dangerous part of the mission for a low level character is the boss.  The bonus is to keep the Sunspear recruits alive for the duration of the mission, this is pretty easy to do, particularly with the level 20 [[Kormir]] there to help you out.
  
  Go either to the left or right from the entrance and kill the corsairs you come across, you will come to barrels of [[Istani Fire Oil]] at the far side of the map from where you entered. You should pick up and carry two of these barrels to the top of the structure in the middle of the area. Load and launch each catapult with a barrel by clicking on the lever twice while holding a barrel. Each ship sinked will provide a [[morale boost]]. When done, continue in the direction you were traveling before and finish off the last of the corsairs.  
  
  If you have two human players doing this mission, you can have one take out the left, and one taking out the right side of the map by each carrying a barrel to both catapults. This will help you to complete the mission faster.

  [[Zhed Shadowhoof]] is one of the [[hero]]es available in [[Guild Wars Nightfall]]. A member of the centaur race with serious reservations about working with hated humans, Zhed must put ancient enmities aside to face a greater enemy. He is a [[centaur]] of the [[Veldrunner]] pride, the last free pride in Kourna.\n\n\
  From the [http://www.guildwars.com/theworld/heroes/ official website] and the manual:\n\
  :''Rebellious Centaur''\n\
  ::''\"Tell me again why I should help you. Where were you, two-legs, when my family was slain by the [[Kournan]] jackals?\"''\n\n\
  :'''Origin:''' [[Centaur]]\n\
  :'''Age:''' 17\n\
  :'''Profession:''' [[Elementalist]]\n\n\
  :''Like many races in the world, the leonine centaurs of [[Elona]] are struggling to survive. They've overcome incredible hardships, including the need to survive without help from more populous races\xE2\x80\x94including, it would seem, humanity. Zhed is a centaur who's keenly aware of this last fact. He's seen his people suffer and die while the masses of humanity continue to spread across the savannah. In fact, he claims to have seen atrocities the Kournans would not dare admit. Some centaurs insist that [[human]]s are responsible for the death of their race, and Zhed certainly agrees. At best, he sees the \"two-legs\" as a means to an end. In the worst of times, he sees them as rivals... or prey. His dealings with humans have not been good, but if he must work with adventurers to reach his goals \xE2\x80\x94 and adventurers need to work with him \xE2\x80\x94 he'll need to set aside his animosity. How long he can be trusted is another matter entirely.''\n\n\

  Zhed starts with Veldrunner armor and a Veldrunner Eye for the headgear.\n\n\
  The appearance of his armor can be upgraded to [[Ancient armor]] using [[Ancient Armor Remnants]] acquired from the [[Remains of Sahlahja]] [[Challenge Mission]]. The appearance of his armor can be upgraded to [[Primeval armor]] using [[Primeval Armor Remnants]] acquired in the [[Domain of Anguish]] and during [[the Ebony Citadel of Mallyx]] mission.\n\n\
  ==Dialogue==\n\
  In the Command Post and Jahai Bluffs:\n\
  :''\"Humans. They always think the world turns on their shoulders. The Centaur people know secrets that you cannot fathom. Our warriors blaze through battle like fire on a dry plain. Your kind can enslave us, but never shall you break our spirits. We fear nothing beneath the open sky.\"''\n\n\
  In Throne of Secrets:\n\
  :''\"Victory!\"''\n\n\
  ==Notes==\n\
  *A duplicate Zhed will show up as a \"Centaur Elementalist\".\n\n\
  ==Trivia==\n\
  *The voice actor for Zhed is also the voice actor for [[Prince Rurik]]. The same voice actor also plays the part of the Prince in the game Prince of Persia: The Warrior Within, as well as the High Prophet of Regret in Halo and Halo 2.\n\

  ==Notes==
  *This skill is used by [[Grasping Ghoul]]s.
  *It heals the activating ghoul for a small amount of health.
  *This ability is a spell and is thus vulnerable to [[Backfire]], [[Savage Slash]], etc.
  *In order to use it, the Grasping Ghoul must be adjacent to a corpse.  However, this will not exploit the corpse.

  ''The largest and arguably most important port in [[Cantha]], Seitung Harbor is the point of entry for most outsiders. Ships traveling to distant [[Tyria]] or the far-flung [[Battle Isles]] depart from Seitung Harbor with dizzying regularity, while the traffic from those distant lands arrives with equal frequency. Canthans with little spare time often say they are "busy as a Seitung Harbormaster". At least, in polite company.''
  
  ==Getting there==
  [[Factions Campaign]] characters need to follow and complete the quest [[the Road Less Traveled]], acquired from [[Master Togo]] in [[Linnok Courtyard]].

  ** Halves skill recharge of spells (Chance: 5%)\n\
  ** Energy +3 (while Health is above 50%)\n\n\
  ==Walkthrough==\n\
  First you must have the [[Devourer Egg]]. This can be obtain by doing [[The Egg Hunter]] quest, or get 5 [[Skale Fin (Pre-Searing)|Skale Fin]]s to the Collector [[Brownlow]] or get 3 [[Dull Carapaces]] to Collector [[Rownan]].\n\
  Simply fallow [[Pitney]] to his field, he will attract the [[Worm Queen]] out of the ground, and kill the bug.\n\

  ==Dialogue==\n\
  ===Initial dialogue===\n\
  '''Pitney'''\n\
  :''\"Ach! These worms will be the death of me! They've driven me off my farm! Doesn't matter how many I kill. As long as there's a queen worm, more will be back the next day.\"''\n\n\
  :''\"Here's what I'm thinking: Worms love devourer eggs, right? Can you get a [[devourer egg]] from [[Fadden Hathorn]] for me? I'll use it to lure the queen into the open, then you can squash her like the bug she is.\"''\n\n\
  :'''Accept:''' ''\"I think I can handle a few worms.\"''\n\
  :'''Decline:''' ''\"Sorry, I'm too busy.\"''\n\
  :'''When asked about quest:''' ''\"Please...if you can get a '''devourer egg''' from '''Fadden Hathorn''', I'm sure we can save my farm. If you can't get one from Fadden, try Brownlow the Collector in Lakeside County.\"''\n\n\
  ===Intermediate dialogue===\n\
  '''Pitney'''\n\
  :''\"All right, I'll try to lure the queen into the open. You do the killing.\"''\n\n\
  ===Reward dialogue===\n\
  '''Pitney'''\n\
  :''\"Thank you so much! Those worms won't be a problem now.\" ''\n\n\
  ==Notes==\n\
  Lower level players should take care of the two Wolves in the field first because they are a big concern."

  | campaign = Factions
  | region = Cantha
  | type = Cooperative
  | duration = Short
  | preceded by = [[Raisu Palace (mission)]]

  ===Objectives===
  * Destroy [[Shiro]]
  
  ===Reward===
  {{Mission reward

     |standard = > 5
     |expert = < 5
     |master = < 2.5
  | hardstd = > 6
  | hardexp = < 6
  | hardmstr = < 3 }}
  
  ==Walkthrough==
  Shiro has five skills which he likes to use and which can make him hard to deal with if you come unprepared.
  
  *[[Battle Scars]]
  This is a stance that enables Shiro to regain health by stealing life as he attacks. The life he steals is based on the highest damage he takes while under this stance, which means the higher the damage he takes, the more life he steals. Just as any stance, it can be ended prematurely by skills like [[Wild Blow]], [[Wild Throw]] or [[Wild Strike]].
  
  *[[Echoing Banishment]]
  This skill will replace targeted player with a bound foe of the same profession, and banish the player to a nearby island. The player can here choose to run the long way to the teleportation orb and rejoin the rest of the team. Or wait in safety for the team to destroy the bound foe which will cause the banished player to return again.
  
  *[[Impossible Odds]]
  Shiro starts using this skill once he drops in health to about 30%. It can be curse as it gives him an incredible attack speed and allows him on inflict tremendous amount of damage in a very short time. He also transfers any conditions he might have to the players he attacks. It can also be a way to get him down fast since it will trigger any skills that involve attacks such as [[Empathy]] or [[Spiteful Spirit]].
  
  *[[Meditation of the Reaper]]
  This skill gets more and more dangerous the longer it's allowed to continue. While in this meditation he will absorb the next 700 damage done to him and can only be ended by dealing that damage to him. When he comes out of this meditation he will steal 20 health from each player for each second it was active. If it stays active for its full 30 seconds he will steal 600 health from each player, which will result in a complete party wipe.
  
  *[[Riposting Shadows]]
  This skill is nasty in combination with Impossible Odds. It will allow him to shadow step to any player and attack and in combination with Impossible Odds it will cause him to jump around from player to player dealing significant damage without any warning.<br><br>
  
  ===Strategies===
  
  '''Hero/Hench'''<br>
  different strategies has been used successfully in this mission, however some of them require that you have access to the Heroes of Nightfall. It is widely known that heroes are not affected by the skill [[Echoing Banishment]], keep in mind though that heroes does not receive the [[celestial skill]] given by [[Kuunavang]]. It might therefor be wise to use your monk heroes  as your healing source to prevent them from getting banished in the heat of battle. Also any bound monk will heal Shiro and this will cause the battle to take longer than necessary. Another thing worth to mention is, if you are the only human player in the team, you cannot be affected by Shiros banishing skill either.<br><br>
  
  If you are going to use the henchmen you might want to consider looking up the skills they have equipped and also what the celestial skill they receive will do. The Necromancer celestial is a fairly useless skill in this case compared to lets say a hero Necromancer with [[Spiteful Spirit]] or [[Spoil Victor]]. The warrior celestial can cause quite a lot of damage so consider bringing both warrior henchmen. The Mesmer henchmen carry skills like [[Empathy]] and also their celestial skill will greatly improve casting speed and recharge time. The Elementalist henchmen carry a very high damage dealing celestial skill but keep in mind that the bound Elementalist which will appear if the henchman gets banished will cause a great deal of damage back to your team instead.<br><br>
  
  '''Warrior strategy'''<br>
  A very well working one which involves getting a lot of warrior players into your team. They will need to equip stances to help them avoid Shiro's attacks and [[Watch Yourself]] to raise the armor. Of course a source of healing might be needed and for that you normally bring monks which will then move into either the north or the south corner of the island to stay out of Shiro's range. There they cannot get banished and will spam skills like [[Heal Party]] and/or [[Light of Deliverance]].<br><br>
  
  '''Elementalist strategy'''<br>
  Bringing an Elementalist with Mesmer as secondary profession will usually cause the team to kill Shiro within 1.5 minutes. This can be achieved by Echo chaining, using [[Arcane Echo]] and [[Echo]] together with the Elementalist's celestial skill to make the caster able to use [[Celestial Storm]] 3 times in a row. If a bound enemy is killed during this process it will cause both 2 copies and the original celestial skill to recharge so they can be cast again on Shiro. By bringing even more Echo chaining Elementalist's, Shiro will go down even faster.
  
  '''Bodyblocking + Impossible Odds strategy'''<br>
  This tactic may work for the whole battle, though so far its author has only attempted it when Shiro was down to one third health (as it is often here where generic strategies may begin to fail you). Bring one or two warriors and at least one player with access to the [[Empathy]] skill. Necromancers are also very useful. Begin to fight Shiro the way you would normally. When he has about one third of his health left, you will notice him using Impossible Odds a lot more frequently. Use Empathy on him. (Contrary to some peoples' beliefs, Empathy DOES trigger for each attack he does while under the effects of Impossible Odds) Have a warrior activate [[Storm of Swords]]. Then all players should stand [[adjacent]] to Shiro so that you all damage him by means of the skill used moments earlier. If a necromancer is there, their [[Star Servant]] ability will spawn a minion which will also greatly contribute to the damage-dealing frenzy. During this time, continue to keep up Empathy on Shiro, as well as to remain adjacent to him and damage him in any other way as well.
  
  ===Other Tips===
  *Note that your [[Celestial Skill]]s, like the [[Resurrection Signet]], only recharge when a boss is slain. Therefore it may be useful to activate them only when really necessary, or when both Shiro and a bound [[Shiro'ken]] player are engaged in battle. The death of the Shiro'ken will instantly recharge the skill.
  
  ===Skill recommendations===
  *If you are /Me or Me/, consider bringing [[Echo]] in place of your regular Elite Skill. It can be used to repeat your Celestial Skill quickly. This is especially useful if your Celestial Skill is a devastating one such as [[Celestial Storm]].
  *Skills that deal damage whilst ignoring armor, such as [[Obsidian Flame]], are obviously a big help to fighting Shiro.

Warrior's Isle: "{{Guild hall infobox\n\
  | image = [[Image:Warriors_Isle.jpg|200px|Warrior's Isle]]\n\
  | region = [[The Battle Isles]]\n\
  }}\n\
  It has happened to many new guilds\xE2\x80\x94they put some wins under their belt but then, suddenly, bump into strange maps and start taking losses. Not from a lack of skill, necessarily, but perhaps from a lack of knowledge about the unfamiliar terrain or assorted quirks of these maps. Talking to the [[Canthan Ambassador]] [[NPC]] in the [[Great Temple of Balthazar]] does help to get a basic orientation for each map, but many map features only become active during an actual [[Guild Battle]].\n\n\
  To see active aspects of your own guild hall, you can simply set up a [[scrimmage]] with at least one other person. This will allow you to see all NPC locations, flag spawn points, gate levers, and any item spawn points. To get comfortable with other guild halls will just take time playing on those maps. However, below we will give you some points to consider and tricks you can use as you move into unfamiliar terrain.\n\n\
  ==[[Guild Thief]]==\n\
  Warrior's Isle features a [[Guild Thief]] that is used to open the gate of the opponents base. To use a Guild Thief, one of the human players on your team will have to ''talk'' to the Guild Thief, and it will follow this person around the map until this player ''talks'' with it again.\n\n\
  The Guild Thief has one primary use, which is to open the gates of the opponents base within the 20 minutes of normal GvG play. (At [[VoD]] all gates open, so the Guild Thief is no longer necessary.)\n\n\
  A secondary use for the Guild Thief on this particular map is to stall the opponents [[NPC]]s from their march to the flagstand when [[VoD]] starts at 20 minutes in the game. The player, who the Thief is following, will ''talk'' with it when it is standing close to the main gate into the opponents base. The opponents [[NPC]]s will start to attack the Guild Thief and while doing this, make a good target for the [[Trebuchet]].\n\n\
  ==Trebuchets==\n\
  Warrior's Isle, like [[Hunter's Isle]] and [[Wizard's Isle]] features two [[Trebuchet]]s, that can be used to lay siege to an area inside the base the Trebuchet overlooks.\n\

  | description =
  The purified waters of the vial affect one target for 10 seconds. [[Harbinger]]s become vulnerable to damage from all sources.
  }}
  
  ==Acquisition==
  This is a temporary skill that can be obtained and used only during the [[Nundu Bay]] mission. It is needed to defeat the [[Harbinger of Twilight|Harbingers of Twilight]] and the [[Harbinger of Nightfall]]. It can be obtained by accepting it from [[Elder Jonah]] at the start of the mission. It will remain on the skill bar until the mission concludes.
  
  ==Notes==
  *The Vial of Purified Water is a [[projectile]], which means a clear [[line of sight]] is necessary, unlike most other [[hex]] spells.
  *The description does not mention this, but this skill also has the ability to inflict 50 armor-ignoring damage and can [[interrupt]] spells, so it can be used against the [[Margonite]]s in the mission. Note that the damage is applied ''before'' the vulnerability effect, so the damage does not take effect when using it against the Harbingers (that are not already hexed).
  *The damage from this spell is affected by a character's [[Lightbringer rank]].
  *As this is a spell, [[Echo]] and [[Arcane Echo]] can copy it.
  
  ==Trivia==
  *This is probably inspired by the use of [[W:Holy water|holy water]] as an [[W:Apotrope|apotrope]] against evil supernatural creatures.

  Learn how to add henchmen to your party so that you don't travel alone. \n\n\

  * Return to Ascalon City. Form a party with another player.\n\n\
  ===Reward===\n\
  * 100 [[Experience]]\n\
  * {{skill icon|Resurrection Signet}}\n\n\
  ==Walkthrough==\n\
  This a very simple and short quest. All that is needed is a fellow party member. If you don't have a friend online, there are generally plenty of players in [[Ascalon City (outpost)|Ascalon City]] wanting to do this quest as well, so if you need someone, just send a message in the [[chat window]]. If you find a player who is willing to join you, and they haven't invited you already, you will need to invite them to join you. If you don't know how to do this, see [[Invite]]. Once you have a full party and both of you are ready, exit Ascalon City towards [[Lakeside County]] and the quest is complete. Speak to Lina the Healer for the reward.\n\n\
  It is worth doing this quest, even if you intend to solo during the entirety of your time in Pre-Searing Ascalon, in order to get the Resurrection Signet; following [[The Searing]] you'll have to pay in order to get it. You may wish to skip this quest if you take Monk as your primary or secondary [[profession]], as reusable [[resurrection skill]]s are available later on, however none are available immediately after reaching post-Searing Ascalon.\n\n\
  ==Dialogue==\n\
  ===Initial dialogue===\n\
  '''Lina the Healer'''\n\
  :''\"With all the dangers out on Lakeside, I can't believe the number of people who go running around by themselves. Why, I've already got my hands full resurrecting fallen soldiers without some novice <profession> adding to the burden! Don't people know that there are plenty of folks in '''Ascalon City''' who'd be perfectly happy to join them in their adventures?\"''\n\n\
  :''\"I'll tell you what, if you promise to do your adventuring with an '''ally''', I'll gladly give you a Signet that can resurrect fallen party members.\"''\n\n\
  :'''Accept:''' ''\"Sounds like a good idea.\"''\n\
  :'''Decline:''' ''\"I prefer doing things on my own.\"''\n\
  :'''When asked about quest:''' ''\"If you want to learn how to resurrect you'll need an ally. You can't resurrect yourself! Go into '''Ascalon City''', and '''form a party''' with another recruit.\"''\n\n\

  :'''Challenge:"You're going down, silent clown."'''
  ::''"This challenge is as grueling as it is difficult. It is entirely possible that your extremities may be so exhausted from our *hiccup* mime duel they simply fall off! Are you will to risk life and *heh* limb?"''
  ::'''Accept:''' ''"Lumo, this day you shall know defeat. Prepare to battle, mime!"''

  Assist the thespian in a permormance to gain his services in your adventures.\n\n\
  ==Quest information==\n\n\
  ===Requirements===\n\
  Having chosen [[Goren]] to accompany [[Midauha]] in Istan in the quest [[Brains or Brawn]].\n\n\
  ===Objectives===\n\
  *Perform with Norgu in Jahinur.\n\
  *Write a short script with Norgu.\n\
  *Perform with Norgu in Pojah Estates.\n\
  *Protect Norgu from the dangers of [[Vehtendi Valley]].\n\
  *Destroy the [[heket]] that have overrun the performance area.\n\
  *Register Norgu's play rights with Records Keeper Palin at the Writing Guild of Vabbi.\n\n\
  ===Reward===\n\
  *2,000 [[Experience]]\n\
  *[[Norgu]] joins your party.\n\n\
  ==Walkthrough==\n\
  The initial quest objective can be approached from either [[Honur Hill]] or [[The Kodash Bazaar|the Kodash Bazaar]].  Going from Honur Hill will take you through Yahnur Market, and while this isn't an often frequented outpost, it does have a skill trainer who may be worth seeing on your way through.\n\n\
  ===From Honur Hill===\n\
  From Honur Hill, head due south along the west side of Resplendent Makuun to arrive at Yahnur Market, then on into \n\
  [[Vehtendi Valley]].  Although the first objective is due west of Yahnur Market, it will be necessary to take a route that turns south, west over the fields, then north to meet with Norgu.  This area mainly has Heket, Behemoths and Kournans.  The Behemoth Gravebanes act as [[minionmancers]] and also inflict hex degen on the party, so kill first if possible.\n\n\
  ===From Kodash Bazaar===\n\
  Very simply, head due south from the bazaar, you will most likely encounter Kournans and some plant mobs along the way.\n\n\
  On meeting Norgu at Jahinur ('''point 1''' on the maps), you'll get the chance to creat a script via some multiple choice Dialogue, then watch the audience response to his \"masterpiece\". After the first performance at Jahinur, you must escort Norgu north to his next engagement (at '''point 2'''), making sure he doesn't die on the way!  As a level 18 mesmer, Norgu provides some assistance, casting [[Clumsiness]], [[Mantra of Persistence]], and [[Conjure Phantasm]] as required.\n\n\
  Once the last objective is activated, it's an easy matter of mapping to the Kodash Bazaar and collecting our reward and a new [[Mesmer|mesmer]] hero.\n\n\
  ==Dialogue==\n\
  <!-- Transcription of dialogue. -->\n\n\
  ===Initial dialogue===\n\
  '''Norgu'''\n\
  :''\"They say that fortune favours the foolish, and you'll find none more foolish than I.  You see, this fight against Varesh...against Abaddon and the Nightfall...will be my opus.  With the role of the villain already cast, I shall throw in with your ensemble.  But first we must determine if we have chemistry.  No spark, no play, you know.  So, let us go unto the breach and perfom in '''Jahinur''', in the '''Vehtendi Valley'''.  I'll prompt you when I need you.\"''\n\
  :'''Accept:''' ''\"Sounds interesting.\"''\n\
  :'''Decline:''' ''\"I'm no fool.  No sirree!\"''\n\
  :'''When asked about quest:''' ''\"Dialogue the quest giver provides when asked about the quest while it is active.\"''\n\n\
  ===Intermediate dialogue===\n\n\
  '''When the party arrives at Jahinur'''\n\
  :'''Norgu:''' ''\"Performing is the most heroic act imaginable. Performing solo is even more heroic. Hmmm.  My fellow guild members should already be here.  Something is amiss.\"''\n\
  :'''Norgu:''' ''\"Quick! Help me write a new scene before I go on.\"''\n\
  :'''Norgu:''' ''\"I don't know what happened to my fellow actors, but the show must go on.  And it shall be gloriously heroic.  Luckily, these are simple folk in Jahinur.  All we need is a stalwart hero, a villan of pure evil, and a brave way for the hero to slay the villain.  Some creative advice from you real heroes will help me really sell it.\"'' (Response: Sure thing! I'm a real hero last time I checked.)\n\n\
  '''Writing the new script'''\n\
  *Who is the hero?  Norgu or <name>\n\
  *What evil does the hero have to fight? an evil lich lord / a disgruntled piemaster / a forgotten, dark god\n\
  *What did the hero do? smote the evil atop a volcano / defeated the evil with minty fresh breath / destroyed the evil in an epic struggle that ended with a magnificent death blow\n\
  *Norgu:''' ''\"Thanks! With your advice, I'm sure this will be the best performance of my career!\"''\n\n\
  '''The Jahinur performance'''\n\
  :'''Norgu:''' ''\"Welcome one and all!  I am the famous Norgu.  Tonight I shall perform a short but riveting piece I wrote myself...with the help of my most heroic friends here.\"''\n\
  :'''Norgu:''' ''\"The brave, brave, BRAVE <hero>, adventuring with many other brave companions, did come upon a great and unthinkable evil of pure evilness.  <name> knew the evil must be destroyed, for it was destroying the countryside. The peasants were sand and almost dead.\"''\n\
  :'''Norgu:''' ''\"\"What is this evil that is killing us and making us sad?\" they cried.  It was <the evil>! The most vile and evil...evil...the world has ever seen.  But our heroic hero could not face the evil yet. First he had to go on a quest for glory, overcoming many hard obstacles along the way before, ultimately, returning to the village, which was nearly, but not quite, destroyed.  There, <hero>...\"''\n\
  :'''Norgu:''' ''\"...<what the hero did>.  Oh how the peasants, who had not yet been eaten by the evil, rejoiced.  They were glad in their heart of hearts that such a hero was in the realm, and that evil was not in the realm...anymore.\"''\n\
  :'''Norgu:''' ''\"Whew! That wasn't too bad, if I do say so myself.\"''\n\
  :'''Jahinur Spectator:''' ''\"That was terrible!\"''\n\
  :'''Norgu:''' ''\"Please, please. No tips! Money only cheapens the performance.... Food, on the other hand, is a different story.\"''\n\
  :'''Jahinur Spectator:''' ''\"The Five Gods help us! That was worse than that Brave Lantern tripe they performed earlier this year.\"''\n\

  | hardmstr = < 25}}
  
  ==Walkthrough==
  The objective of the mission is to destroy four [[spirit rift]]s that [[Shiro Tagachi|Shiro]] has opened to summon an army of [[Shiro'ken]]. 
  
  At the beginning of the mission, the party will be given the [[Spear of Archemorus]] and the [[Urn of Saint Viktor]]. These are provided as boosts, carrying them is not required to complete the mission, though they obviously do help.
  
  A bridge will come down and the mission will start, there will be two groups of [[Afflicted]] followed by an area with large metal craters in it. These are called [[flame fissure]]s and they will cause [[burning]] and [[crippled]] to anyone who passes over them. 
  
  At the end of that area will be a spirit rift, a large sphere of light, guarded by a [[Spirit of Portals]] and some [[Shiro'ken Assassin]]s. Destroying the spirit is the way to close the spirit rift. Also, as long as the Spirit of Portals stands it will keep summoning Shiro'ken Assassins to replace any killed. So, it's better to kill the spirit first.
  
  The party can proceed left or right from this point. If the party proceeds right, they will come across Shiro suspended inside a spirit rift himself, he will be inaccessible at this time. Past this area there will be a few groups of Afflicted with a path to the left and the right. To the right will be the second spirit rift guarded by [[Shiro'ken Ranger]]s. Careful [[aggro]] is necessary here as there is one group of afflicted, the rangers and then another group behind them and the area is dotted with squares of spikes that cause [[bleeding]] and crippled when walked over. Taking each group at a time makes the fight easier. Once again, the party will need to eliminate the Spirit of Portals.
  
  The party should continue and go down the other path where they took the fork. Down that path they will come to a spirit rift with a Spirit of Portals atop a small hill with [[Shiro'ken Necromancer]]s guarding them. The hill is surrounded with [[poison]]ed water. 
  
  Past this, the party will turn right, getting out of the poisoned water and face a few more groups of Afflicted. After them, the fourth and final rift and Spirit of Portals will be there guarded by [[Shiro'ken Warrior]]s. The plates in this area cause [[dazed]], so casters should be careful. 
  
  After the fourth Spirit of Portals and it's guardians are destroyed, a [[cinematic]] will play and then the party will be in the central area where Shiro was previously, facing 4 Construct [[boss]]es. It's important that the party moves back to the left corner and not allow [[Mhenlo]] and [[Master Togo]] to engage all four bosses at once. With the extra damage that bosses have, the fight can become very difficult. After settling in that corner, the party will be followed by one boss most likely. Finish that boss off then slowly pull the others one or two at a time. After all four are killed, the mission is over.

  ==Armor==
  Acolyte Sousuke starts with Elementalist Zaishen armor, which is nearly identical in appearance to blue [[Elementalist Shing Jea Armor]], as well as a Zaishen Eye for a headgear. His armor has an [[armor rating]] of 34 to 60, depending on his level.
  
  The appearance of his armor can be upgraded to [[Elite Sunspear Armor]] using [[Stolen Sunspear Armor]] acquired from the [[Dajkah Inlet]] [[Challenge Mission]]. The appearance of his armor can be upgraded to [[Primeval armor]] using [[Primeval Armor Remnants]] acquired in the [[Domain of Anguish]] and during [[the Ebony Citadel of Mallyx]] mission.
  
  ==Dialogue==
  In Sun Docks and Plains of Jarin:
  :''"Well, good day! My name is Sousuke. You're lucky you've come upon me in a good mood. I've fried people for looking at me like that. Ha, ha. Just kidding! I'm usually very careful with my elemental magic. I wouldn't hurt a fly. Well, perhaps, if it was [[Kourna]]n."''
  
  In Throne of Secrets:
  :''"The fire! The explosions! The valiant fights! It's a tale of heroes, and you're the greatest one!"''
  
  ==Notes==
  *A duplicate Acolyte Sousuke will show up as a "Zaishen Elementalist".
  
  ==Trivia==
  *This character may be a reference to Sasuke in the anime Naruto as they have similar names, hair style, and they both come from Japan (Cantha being oriental).

  == Notes ==
  *Consider this skill for a cheap alternative to [[Fevered Dreams]], as it doesn't require your [[elite]] slot, costs less energy, isn't vulnerable to hex removal, doesn't require any [[attribute]] point investment, and casts faster. However, it only works in [[Adjacent]] range, unlike Fevered Dreams.
  *This skill is used mostly by secondary Mesmers (Any/Me) since the low energy costs and quick cast and recharge times make it easily accessible, while Mesmers themselves aren't that good at inflicting Conditions.
  *Although the description of that skill says : "Transfer all negative Conditions ...", it does not transfer the conditions but copy them to adjacent foes with their remaining duration. Thus, when cast upon a target, the target keeps its conditions.
  *Consider using this skill with [[Broad Head Arrow]] and [[Apply Poison]] as the effects of a covered AoE daze can be potentially lethal to a team of casters.

  Killing the [[Guild Lord]] is the main objective of each opposing team in [[GvG]] battle. Both teams have a level 20 Guild Lord in their base. He is a powerful [[NPC]] with 2400hp , 5 pips of health regeneration and hexes and conditions only last half their duration.
  
  At the start of each [[GvG]] battle, the Guild Lord cannot lose more than 50 health per second. Over the first 15 minutes of the game, the health loss limit gradually increases up to 250 health per second.
  
  If the Guild Lord takes damage that would go over this limit, the difference is brought by his [[Amulet of Protection]]. If the Guild Lord loses health due to damage-over-time effects or other direct loss of health, then once every second, his amulet heals him for the amount of health he lost that exceeds the limit.
  
  The limit will increases at a constant rate of 11.6% per minute, starting when the game clock reads 0:00 and the gates open. Guild Lords can take a huge ammount of damage and can withstand it as well, usually though two solo gankers can take him out later in the game if they can perform a split.

  ==Walkthrough==\n\
  Agnar can be found on a hill south east of [[The Barradin Estate]]. He will not attack until he is attacked. When his health goes below 50%, he will use his [[Agnar's Rage]] skill. Use Hammer Bash to interrupt it or try to kill him before he's done casting it.\n\n\

  :''\"The trick with a hill giant is to watch for his Rage skill and interrupt it. I can give you the Hammer Bash skill to knock him down when he tries it, and even loan you one of my hammers if you need it, but it will be up to you to time it right and defeat him.\"''\n\n\
  :'''Accept:''' ''\"I am not afraid.\"''\n\

  :''\"You defeated Agnar, then? Well, well...not bad for a beginner. You can keep the hammer for certain, and I expect I won't hear much about Agnar any more around here. I do, however, expect to hear much more about you. It is a tough world out there for Warriors to conquer.\"''"

  There is a patrol of lost White Mantle wandering around that needs eliminating. The Shining Blade could also use whatever they can salvage off them.\n\n\

  ===Objectives===\n\
  * Tell [[Gareth Quickblade]] about the lost [[White Mantle]] patrol.\n\
  * Meet the [[Shining Blade]] scouts [[Silverwood]].\n\
  * Seek out and destroy the White Mantle patrol.\n\
  * Collect 5...0 more ruined White Mantle armors.\n\

  ==Walkthrough==\n\
  Once you have the quest go to [[Quarrel Falls]] and talk to Gareth.  It is suggested that first-time players not do this until you complete [[Bloodstone Fen]], otherwise the actions you need to undertake in the quest will confuse you.  Completing Bloodstone Fen will also put you right in Quarrel Falls.\n\n\
  Go outside and meet up with the [[Shining Blade Scouts]].  They will head off to the north for you to follow.  They will [[aggro]] everything in their path and can die easily, but don't need to be kept alive for the quest.  Alternatively, you can head out of [[Bloodstone Fen (outpost)|Bloodstone Fen]].  Kill the patrol, and pick up the ruined armors they drop.  Head back to Quarrel Falls for your reward.\n\n\
  ==Dialogue==\n\n\
  ===Initial dialogue===\n\
  '''Alari Doubleblade'''\n\
  :''\"I have learned recently that a White Mantle patrol entered the forest and has become lost.  They were last spotted somewhere in Silverwood.  Report to '''Gareth Quickblade''' in '''Quarrel Falls''' and let him know that there are White Mantle in the woods.\n\n\

  :'''When asked about quest:''' ''\"Let '''Gareth Quickblade''' in '''Quarrel Falls''' know that a White Mantle patrol has gotten lost in Silverwood.\"''\n\n\
  ===Intermediate dialogue===\n\
  '''Gareth Quickblade'''\n\
  :''\"The White Mantle think they can send patrols into our forests and not pay the price? They'll soon learn the cost of crossing the Shining Blade! I'll have several scouts meet you in Silverwood. They'll lead you to this White Mantle patrol. Wipe out the patrol and bring me their armor when you are done. We should be able to salvage some useable steel from them.\"''\n\n\
  :'''Shining Blade Scout:''' ''\"Follow me. Hurry, before the White Mantle patrol escapes the forest.\"''\n\n\
  ===Reward dialogue===\n\

  [[Gorgaan Hatemonger]] is a [[Charr]] boss that players can randomly encounter while venturing through any Charr-infested area. Like all [[Charr]] [[Warrior]]s, his use of [[Frenzy]] makes him susceptible to large amounts of [[spike]] damage, however, his ability to block attacks and heal himself makes him somewhat more durable.

  ==Quest information==\n\
  ===Requirements===\n\
  * [[Prophecies]] character.\n\
  * [[Warrior]] profession (either secondary or primary).\n\n\
  ===Objectives===\n\
  * Find Old Mac's body out in the Breach.\n\
  * Escort Old Mac back to Piken Square.\n\
  * Return to Armsman Pitney for your reward.\n\n\
  ===Reward===\n\
  * 250 [[Experience]]\n\
  *{{skill icon|Mighty Blow}}\n\
  *{{skill icon|Dismember}}\n\n\
  ==Walkthrough==\n\n\
  It is recommended that you try and complete this quest when you receive it, regardless of your level, skills or equipment, as it is quite easy and awards nice skills. \n\n\
  The easiest place from which to start is Piken Square. After exiting Piken, travel West towards some old ruins with Charr Ash Walkers. Defeat them and climb the slope. Start watching out for patrols, as several Charr patrol groups consisting of a Charr Mesmer and two Charr Rangers patrol around here. Move up the slope, untill you reach a small area with Charr Elementalists.  Defeat them, and watch out for the patrols nearby. Try to take out the patrols seperately. Afterwards move towards the south for a bit while looking for an entry into the rock wall to the west. It's fairly obvious, and normally contains a Charr Overseer, Martyr and Axe Warrior (visible on the radar). Kill them.\n\
  Move onward and you'll soon see Old Mac. Near him are normally a Charr Overseer and a Martyr. They may be attacking him. Try to protect as when he dies, you will need to start over.\n\n\
  After destroying the Overseer and Martyr move back to Piken through the route you came. There should be no opposition. Wait for a few seconds before passing through the portal.\n\n\
  ==Dialogue==\n\n\
  ===Initial dialogue===\n\
  '''Armsman Pitney'''\n\
  :''\"After the Searing, I couldn't just sit there and do nothing. Ashford was destroyed, and I'd be damned if I wasn't gonna fight for what was left of Ascalon. Turns out I even had some natural ability with weapons, so the prince and the duke welcomed me into their Vanguard, and I haven't looked back. Things can get a little lonely out here on the frontlines, though, and watching most of your friends die can really take it out of you. '''Old Mac''' was just about the only one from the old days left, and he and his creepy pet went missing during our last battle.\n\
  :''\"Would you do me a favor and head to the Breach? See if you can find his body?\"''\n\n\
  :'''Accept:''' ''\"I'll find his body for you.\"''\n\

  :''\"Pitney sent you out here because he thought I was dead? Why that ugly son of a Grawl! He thinks he'll outlast me in this war does he? Me and Joe here will show him! Lead the way back to Piken and let's prove him wrong!\"''\n\n\
  :'''Old Mac:''' ''\"Ah, Piken Square at last. You go tell Pitney that Old Mac and Joe made it back safe and sound.\"''\n\n\
  ===Reward dialogue===\n\
  '''Armsman Pitney'''\n\
  :''\"He's alive?  I knew he was tough, but to last out there by himself... Well, I suppose he had that creepy pet of his to help him survive.  He's never going to let me hear the end of this, still it'll be good to have him back.  I can't thank you enough, '''[Player Name]'''.  You're a credit to Ascalon.\"''"

  *The Black Bear is first seen at level 3 in [[Pre-Searing Ascalon]]. Despite being at a low level, charming this animal is considered quite difficult. Early on in the game, this normally requires a [[party]] of 2 to charm the Bear. In the [[Southern Shiverpeaks]] the Black Bear will be at level 5 but will be much easier to charm.\n\n\

  Retrieve the royal scribe's papers by getting them out of a chest in [[Stingray Strand]] which is guarded by a group of [[Tengu]]. The location of the chest is actually geographically closer to [[Sanctum Cay (outpost)]], so it may be easier for a party to depart from this location. There are a few groups of [[Skale]] and [[Inferno Imp]]s along the way, so be prepared.\n\n\

  :''\"With the true nature of the White Mantle revealed, it is time to restore the Royal Family of Kryta to power. Unfortunately, the Royal Family was largely destroyed during the Charr invasions, and those who survived fled across the sea. The Royals, however, were known for their...er...indiscretions, and it is likely that there are a few with royal blood in their veins who still live in Kryta. I had arranged for papers from the royal scribe to be brought to me that I might examine them and find a legitimate successor to the throne, but the caravan I sent for was plundered by the Tengu in '''Stingray Strand''' and the chest containing the papers was carried off.\"''\n\

  ==Mission information==\n\n\
  ===Requirements===\n\
  Access to [[House zu Heltzer]].\n\n\
  ===Objectives===\n\
  * Kill [[Urgoz]].\n\n\
  ==Walkthrough==\n\
  ===Overview===\n\
  Most sections have [[Twisted Bark]], which emits an [[Environment Effect]], and a [[Guardian Serpent]] at the end, which must be killed to open the gate to the next area.\n\
  This mission can take 3-5 hours, but don't rush it because then it will fail. With a good party, you can be done in about 2 hours but not much less than that.\n\n\
  ===Condition===\n\
  * Weakness: While suffering from this Condition, you deal less damage with attacks and all of your attributes are reduced by 1.\n\n\
  ===Environment effects===\n\
  * Life Drain: While in the area, foes suffer from -15 Health degeneration.\n\
  * Sheer Exhaustion: While in the area, every spell cast by a foe causes Exhaustion.\n\
  * Energy Drain: While in the area, foes suffer from -4 Energy degeneration.\n\n\
  ===Section 1 (Weakness)===\n\
  {{section-stub}}\n\
  This area has [[Hopping Vampire]] and [[Thought Stealer]] popups at the start which kill you very fast (but they're only level 10 so you should kill them quite easy). Although they are easily killed, they have skills called ''suicide energy and suicide health'' which will either kill you instantly or take all of your energy instantly according to which one was used. They die in the process of using the skill, hence ''suicide''. If you travel further you'll see lots of groups of [[Dredge]]s, try to lure one group at once. If you just rush into the dredge groups, you'll die quite fast as you'll have no chance against the 20-30 dredges that will be attacking you. It's recommended to have a trapper and a ritualist to create spirits and traps at the beginning of the area which gives you the [[Weakness]] condition, and then lure one dredge group at a time to the traps and spirits. After you killed 3 groups of [[Dredge]]s you can continue to the [[Twisted Bark]]. Once he's dead, the weakness will go away. Continue straight on, to the stairs, and kill the next patrols of [[Dredge]]s. Kill the [[Guardian Serpent]] to open the door to the next room.\n\n\
  Keep in mind when you go left or right a group of [[Greater Blood Drinker]]s will spawn.\n\n\
  ===Section 2 (Health Degeneration)===\n\
  {{section-stub}}\n\
  Once you enter this area, try to look how far you can go without having Health Degen. The puller should pull the [[Dredge]] first around the corner. Lure the other groups of [[Greater Blood Drinker]]s around the corner. When the area is clear, rush for the [[Twisted Bark]] and the [[Life Drain]] will stop. Now continue carefully to the [[Guardian Serpent]] but be careful with [[Greater Blood Drinker]]s spawns. They usually spawn in groups of 2-4, so they shouldn't be a problem if you don't rush to far and get more spawns. Kill the [[Guardian Serpent]] and the door will open to room 3\n\n\
  ===Section 3 (no environmental effect)===\n\
  {{section-stub}}\n\
  Once the door is open, pull the big groups of [[Brooding Thorn]]s and [[Burning Brush]]es. Once all of these are dead, you'll see a bridge in front of you. The best way to continue is to run under the bridge with the full party, and kill the [[Dredge]]s from underneath the bridge. Once all the dredges are dead, someone needs to open the gate by using a teleport skill like [[Consume Corpse]] or [[Necrotic Traversal]] and use both of the switches located either side of the bridge. Then he can go down with one of the teleporters.\n\n\
  If no one has a teleport skill as mentioned above, the party can't continue in Urgoz, and will have to restart. So it is very important to double check when you start, if someone has [[Consume Corpse]] or [[Necrotic Traversal]].\n\n\
  ===Section 4 (no environmental effect)===\n\
  {{section-stub}}\n\
  This section consists of a long bridge over a pit, with [[Fire Flower]]s along each side. If someone runs on the bridge the [[Fire Flower]]s act like turrets and will spit fire on him/her. Let the puller run on the bridge while the monks are using skills like until a group of [[Thorn Wolf|Thorn Wolves]] will spawn. Once the puller reaches the safe spot in the middle of the bridge, [[Hopping Vampire]] and [[Thought Stealer]] will spawn at the beginning of the bridge. Once this group is dead, the full party can run to the safe spot (where no flowers can hit you). Do the same thing for the second part of the bridge. Once you are near the end of the bridge another spawn of [[Hopping Vampire]] and [[Thought Stealer]] will appear. After you killed these you can safely kill the [[Guardian Serpent]] and open the gate to room 5.\n\n\
  ===Section 5 (Exhaustion)===\n\
  {{section-stub}}\n\
  This section has quite a big room with 3 exits, but you only need the one straight in front of you. Let the puller lure the [[Thorn Wolf|Thorn Wolves]] who will pop up. Lure them back to your party at the gate and finish them off, note that halfway through this room the environmental effect kicks in.\n\n\
  Once the way is cleared to the next gate, proceed over the bridge. In this small room you'll see a few [[Thorn Wolf|Thorn Wolves]] on the left hand side, you can pass them on the right hand side, because you need to cross the room towards the right hand side anyway. A few groups of [[Thorn Wolf|Thorn Wolves]] will pop up in this little room.\n\n\
  On arrival at the next gate, you will notice on the left side of that gate is a tiny hill you can get on, there is no longer exhaust effect if you are on that little hill. Puller should make another diagonal run to the right towards the next gate, pulling all pop-up  [[Thorn Wolf|Thorn Wolves]] on his way. Once safe, proceed to the next gate.\n\n\
  ===Section 6 (no effect)===\n\
  {{section-stub}}\n\
  The room in front of you is pretty small, and you only see 3 Brushes, but there are [[Thorn Wolf|Thorn Wolves]] pop-ups here. Let the puller lure them all to the rest of the party. Straight in front of you is another gate, which leads to the room with giant mushrooms.\n\
  Defend this gate while the puller lures all the pop-up [[Thorn Wolf|Thorn Wolves]] and clears the way to the bridge which is on the right hand side half way through the room. Once on the bridge, you're safe.\n\n\
  [[Thorn Wolf|Thorn Wolves]] like to hide below ground level in this room as well, let the puller lure them to your party. In this room you need to make a 270\xC2\xB0 turn to continue, meaning enter the room and keep as much to the right hand side as possible, entering a room which looks like an area of [[The Underworld]] and leaving it straight away on then right hand again. No pop-ups in this bright room.\n\
  You are under the bridge you were just on, and need to take out approximately 3 groups on the way to the next bridge. \n \n\
  ===Section 7 (Energy degeneration)===\n\
  {{section-stub}}\n\
  Do this correct and you have cleared this section in 5 minutes. One of the party members needs to stay off the bridge, he needs to be left behind on the yellow dot of the map while the rest of the team crosses the bridge and kills the [[Guardian Serpent]]. The player who is left behind can only enter the room when the rest of the party crossed the exit of that room. The reason one party member has to stay behind is because if all party members are in this room at the same time, approximately 150 foes spawn inside the room. Now cross the room on the left hand side. Notice you got the environment effect Energy Drain here. Walk over the bridge in the room and take a sharp turn left towards the next [[Guardian Serpent]]. Kill him and all of the 11 party members should proceed out of the room and over the bridge.\n\n\
  Only when all 11 party members are over the bridge, the party member who stayed behind is allowed to join up with the rest.\n\n\
  ===Section 8 (Exhaustion, Weakness)===\n\
  {{section-stub}}\n\
  This is quite a difficult area where 2 effects are influencing you. Exhaust on the left hand side and Weakness on the right hand side, so best kill the [[Twisted Bark]] on the left first to get rid of the Exhaustion.\n\n\
  Lure out the [[Burning Brush]]es towards the gate and kill them in the environment free area. Only a few Brushes will be left, a small group near the [[Guardian Serpent]] at the gate in front of you, and a small group on either hill (left and right where the [[Twisted Bark]]s are) but you can kill them later on.\n\
  There are also 4 groups of [[Warden]]s left, 2 on each side, patrolling up and down. Lure them outside the room so you suffer from any [[Environment Effect]]. Lure them one group at a time and focus mainly on the [[Maddened Song Warden]]s (healers) and [[Maddened Earth Warden]]s (massive earth damage).\n\n\
  Once the 4 groups of [[Warden]]s are down, proceed to the left hill. Taking out [[Burning Brush]]es and the [[Twisted Bark]] that causes the Exhaustion. Monks can stay outside the room if they brought [[Heal_Party]].\n\
  If the exhaust effect is gone, kill the middle group of [[Burning Brush]]es and the right group on top of the hill. Take out the [[Twisted Bark]] to get rid of the Weakness effect. Now Kill the [[Guardian Serpent]] to enter the next room.\n\n\
  ===Section 9 (no effect)===\n\
  {{section-stub}}\n\
  Section 9 can take some time to clear but should be done quite fast if lured correctly and efficiently. This room is filled with [[Warden]]s and [[Burning Brush]]es. Lure the first group of [[Warden]]s to the top of the stairs. Focus mainly on the [[Maddened Song Warden]]s and [[Maddened Earth Warden]]s. Then kill the [[Burning Brush]]es who are guarding the door on the bottom of the stairs.\n\
  This door will provide you with an excellent location to attack the next groups, because the [[Warden]]s can be blocked here.\n\n\
  Kill any [[Burning Brush]]es if needed, they are guarding their spot and shouldn't move around too much. 3 Groups of [[Warden]]s you can kill here at the door. The last group (diagonal from where you are) will not follow as far as the door before loosing agro.\n\
  Mind the traps the [[Burning Brush]] left behind and kill the last group of [[Warden]]s in the middle of the room (there is a big three where casters can hide behind).\n\
  Kill the [[Guardian Serpent]].\n\n\
  ===Section 10 (no effect)===\n\
  {{section-stub}}\n\
  Closing in on the next room you see a door. One party member (monk for example) needs to stay outside of that room (see map), otherwise the door will close and you will be foe food! Let puller lure all groups of [[Thorn Wolf|Thorn Wolves]] and [[Greater Blood Drinker]]s towards the gate, one group at a time of course.\n\
  There are lots of pop-ups here before you clear the room. Only at the end the next door will open so you can proceed.\n\
  Mind that pop-up locations are random. If you clear half of the room, the next pop-up can spawn right at the start of the room. So precaution is needed here.\n\
  Even if the door opens on the other side, you should let the puller check for any more pop-ups on the way through.\n\n\
  Once you made it through that room, continue down the road and you'll see a [[Twisted Bark]] there which causes Life Drain, you can kill him easily as there are no pop-ups here.Ignore the [[Guardian Serpent]] on the right and left.\n\n\
  ===Section 11 (no effect, Urgoz)===\n\
  {{section-stub}}\n\
  Urgoz is in the center of this area, accompanied by two [[Greater Serpent]]s. Urgoz uses [[Forest's Binding]], which has an extremely long range, damages a foe and hexes them with [[Binding Chains]]. If characters get close enough to Urgoz, [[Explosive Growth (Creature)|Explosive Growths]] will spawn. If it survives for several seconds, an Explosive Growth will die, causing an [[Exploding Spores]] effect, which will inflict 300 dmg on you. It is not known if killing Explosive Growths will prevent the Exploding Spores effect. Don't stand still too long on the same spot or you will die. Kill [[Urgoz]] and your objective is completed.\n\n\

  ==Notes==\n\
  ===Party considerations===\n\
  There is no so called \"standard build\" for Urgoz's Warren but there are some things you have to think of when arranging your team:\n\
  * You need heavy AoE damage as the mobs are pretty big. If you take Rangers with [[Barrage]] or with [[Trap|traps]], Elementalists with [[Meteor Shower]] or [[Searing Flames]], Necromancers with [[Spiteful Spirit]] or something completely different doesn't matter.\n\
  * When arranging, look out for synergetics - for example a paragon with [[\"They're on Fire!\"]] might be extremely useful when you have many elementalists in your party. Also a Ritualist with [[Splinter Weapon]] is an good combination with [[Barrage]]-rangers.\n\
  * A Monk more is always a good idea - a Ritualist or a Paragon may be as useful as a Monk.\n\
  * Don't stick on classes or builds - it is more important the people know what they do than to let them unwillingly use forced build they're not used to.\n\
  * Taking a minion master or spirit spammer will be a good idea to occupy the mob while AoE damage brings them down.\n\
  * You can succeed this mission with nearly every build - as long as you act as team. So the most important aspect is, that you can rely on your party members. If you're a Barrage team and the Ritualist leaves, then you will probably fail - as well if some other key character leaves. Try to assign the key roles to guildmates or friends you realy can rely on.\n\
  * Take your time and check if everyone has minimum 4 hours of time. You will fail if you try to rush and aggro as much as possible to be quicker - you're only quicker dead. Soloactions of one player running in (towards a chest for example) will endanger the whole mission. Make this clear to everyone before you start. If you just do it step by step and as team, you will succeed.\n\n\
  ===Skill considerations===\n\
  * [[Edge of Extinction]] is something very useful in Urgoz's Warren. Place it behind doors or walls so it is no primary target to the mobs. \n\
  * Your party size is 12, so [[Heal Party]], [[Light of Deliverance]] or [[Aegis]] are very effective.\n\
  * Take care of energy management - or take care that anyone has some form of energy management with them. The easy way is to take a Necromancer with [[Blood is Power]] into your team. If that one is equipped as 55hp / 1hp Necromancer, energy should be no problem to anyone and your monks, elementalists and ranger trappers will praise you - as long as you take care that \"the BiP\" stays alive (pretty nasty as he only has one health point). Remember to bring a resurrection spell that resurrects at full health points, 25% of one health point is zero health points or deaths.\n\
  * Double check someone has [[Necrotic Traversal]] or [[Consume Corpse]] with him otherwise you will be stuck in room 3.\n\
  * [[Hex|Hex]] removal skills are useful, [[Thorn_Wolf|Thorn Wolf]] use [[Shroud_of_Silence| Shroud of Silence]] which can quickly render your monk's useless.\n\n\

  }}\n\n\
  ==Quest information==\n\
  ===Objectives===\n\
  * Hunt down [[Wianuyo]] to bring peace to the ghost of Sehwanu\n\
  * See Sehwanu for your reward\n\n\
  ===Reward===\n\
  * 2,000 [[Experience]]\n\
  * 200 [[Gold]]\n\
  * 20 [[Sunspear Promotion Point]]\n\
  * [[Battle Commendation]]\n\n\
  ==Walkthrough==\n\
  '''Getting the quest'''\n\
  :The Ghost of Sehwanu is staring out to the sea on an island at the southwestern edge of the [[Mehtani Keys]]. You will find her standing somewhere between the warrior boss [[Bloodback Morrob]] and his cultists and the shipwreck from Cantha with the Jade cubes where the corsairs are gathering.\n\n\
  '''The quest itself'''\n\
  :Wianuyo himself is on the south-eastern edge of [[Lahtenda Bog]], near a lagoon. \n\n\
  :You enter [[Lahtenda Bog]] through [[Blacktide Den]] and follow the easterly path through the flower-labyrinth, turning south as soon as possible. The enemies encountered are the usual insects level 12 to 15, the two corsair groups around Wianuyo are level 15-17. Luring the groups from the outskirts results in enemy groupings of about 3 persons, easy to pick off. \n\n\
  :Your monk might want to bring two condition removal spells since poison, disease and the other conditions are rather common in the bog. An earth elementalist with ward spells can also come in handy, since a lot of the enemies encountered are short-range fighters.\n\n\
  :Wianuyo himself is a Mesmer level 14 and no big challenge for a coordinated group.\n\n\
  :Map back to [[Kodlonu Hamlet]] and see Sehwanu for your reward. Since for this you need to kill [[Bloodback Morrob]] once more to get to Sehwanu, you might want to check your groups' skill mix again.\n\n\
  ==Dialogue==\n\
  ===Initial dialogue===\n\
  '''Ghost of Sehwanu'''\n\
  :''\"[Difficulty: Master] I was young and carefree once, but oh so foolish. When a battered and bruised man named Wianuyo washed ashore I took him in and tended his wounds, falling in love as I nursed him back to health. He convinced me to steal away with him, back to the high seas. He seemed a good man, but once aboard he showed his true character, and I became a slave for him and his crew. I cooked and cleaned and... It was horrible! After years of slavery, my body succumbed to illness and they dumped me on the dunes to die. I've wandered here ever since; never feeling peace. Please find Wianuyo and bring him to justice so I might rest.\"''\n\n\
  ===Reward dialogue===\n\
  '''Ghost of Sehwanu'''\n\
  :''\"Thank you, kind Sunspear. A brutal death was the only justice Wianuyo deserved. I thought his death would bring me peace as well, but I still feel bound here. Perhaps my soul is doomed to walk the dunes as a warning to the foolish.\"''\n\n\
  ==Trivia==\n\
  The Ghost of Sehwanu spawns randomly. You might need to enter the Mehtani Keys repeatedly to get the quest. If totally unsuccessful, team up with a player going in to claim the reward from Sehwanu - she will be there then."

  | region = Istan
  | type = Cooperative
  | requiredhero = Dunkoro
  | duration = Medium
  | preceded by = [[The Time is Nigh]]
  | followed by = [[Hunted!]]
  }}
  '''Consulate Docks''' is the first mission in the Nightfall campaign for characters from non-Nightfall campaigns.  You join the Sunspears as they assault [[Gandara, the Moon Fortress]] in an attempt to depose Varesh and end her threat to Elona.  Make sure you have [[Dunkoro]] in your party to enter.
  
  ==Mission information==
  ===Requirements===
  You need to have Dunkoro in your party to enter this mission.  
  
  ===Objectives===
  Assault Gandara
  * Unite the western and southern attack fronts. 
  * Capture the forward wall!
  * '''Added''' Defeat the Kournan Gate Captain to prevent him from summoning Kournan troops. 
  * '''Added''' Kill the siege engineers manning the firespitters to clear the way for the southern attack front. 
  * '''Added''' Capture the Kournan bombard to gain entrance to the heart of Gandara.
  * '''Added''' Rally the attack force outside the Plaza of the Five Gods.
  * '''Bonus''' Eliminate the [[Kournan Field Commander|Kournan field marshal]] groups.
  
  ===Reward===
  In this mission, the rewards depend on how many Kournan field marshal groups you destroy.
  {{Mission reward
  | objective = Marshal groups defeated
  | standard = 0 - 1
  | expert = 2
  | master = 3 }}
  
  ==Walkthrough==
  For this mission, all members of the party will be [[buff]]ed with [[Sunspear Battle call]] which increases maximum health and armor.  This can assist lower level players to get through the mission more easily.
  
  Leave the boat and head to the left.  You will launch straight into fighting the Kournans alongside your Sunspear allies.  Be wary when you approach groups of [[Kournan Bowman|Kournan Bowmen]] situated at the top of stairs, often their attacks will focus on one target, making them deadly to those who are unprepared. If you are a spellcaster, try to approach from behind walls if you can, and use skills which reduce bow damage or prevent bow attacks from hitting you.
  
  Once you've killed the bowmen here (1 on the map), go down the stairs and towards the gate.  Here(2) [[Captain Lumanda]] is the gate guard who is able to call in reinforcements, so kill him first and then the rest of the Kournans to open the gate into the next area.
  
  In the next area, your reinforcements are trapped behind some flaming traps(3).  Kill the enemies in this area and then the Kournan Engineers to allow your reinforcements through.
  
  Continue forward, killing Kournans as you find them.  You have to kill enough to capture the bombards(4) to allow you to open the next gate.  Beyond that gate is the [[elementalist]] boss, [[Captain Mwende]], whom like other elementalist bosses in Nightfall, will deal additional damage with their spells.  Stay spread out and if possible, interrupt the spells that are cast.
  
  Travel up the stairs and follow the right wall, killing Kournans on the way until you reach the main square to complete the mission.
  
  ===Bonus===
  
  There are several groups of Kournans on the map in which you have to kill to obtain masters for this mission. These groups are located as yellow markers on the map provided.
  
  The first is to the left at top of the first set of stairs that you come across, before the gate guard.  The second is situated on the wall if you walk on past the bombards, so capture the bombards and head for this group before you take on the elementalist boss.  The next group is to the right at the top of the first stairs after the elementalist boss, don't go left first by mistake or you could finish the mission before you're able to do the bonus.
  
  ===Skill recommendations===
  *[[Stance]] breaking skills to use against the Kournan rangers
  *Skills which block ranged attacks, such as [["Shields Up!"]], or provide damage reduction over time, such as [[Shielding Hands]]
  *All the enemies you will face will leave exploitable corpses.  So Minion Masters should be able to create a substantial force to  overwhelm the soldiers

  [[Vatlaaw Doomtooth]] is a [[Charr]] [[Ranger]] [[boss]] who first appears near [[Ashford Village]] during the quest [[Trouble in the Woods]].  He spawns next to the small plant on the left side of the road, near where the citizens are standing (before you start the quest).
  Vatlaaw is also the final objective to completing the [[Ascalon Academy]] mission, and upon defeating him and his party you trigger a video depicting Ascalon's near destruction, and are then transported to the ruins of Ascalon after a two-year time jump forward.

  ==Notes==
  * During the quest [[Trouble in the Woods]] Vatlaaw will occasionally become blocked/stuck and not make his escape.  He will not fight back and can be easily killed.  This however, does not affect his role in the later [[Ascalon Academy]] mission.
  
  * If you wish to kill Vatlaaw Doomtooth during the [[Trouble in the Woods]] quest, the only sure way to do so is to do this quest with a partner of significant level, whom can be waiting at Vatlaaw's spawn point up the road from the [[Ashford Village]].  Upon spawning Vatlaaw will immediately begin to cast Favorable Winds, then turn and begin to run away, fleeing through the portal to [[Regent Valley]].  You will have to act quickly, but can kill him before he reaches the portal.
  
  * Ironically, Vatlaaw Doomtooth uses both Ignite Arrows and Barrage, despite the fact that Barrage cancels any preparations you  are currently under.  Thus making his Ignite Arrows skill mostly worthless.
  
  * Vatlaaw Doomtooth is also one of only two enemies in Pre-Searing who has an Elite Skill.  The other is Bill, the [[Rogue Bull]].

  [[Goren]] is a [[warrior]] [[hero]] available in [[Guild Wars Nightfall]]. A slow, solid, dependable bodyguard who makes up for what he lacks in wits with an ironclad devotion. He was in the employ of [[Prince Bokka the Magnificent]] as a bodyguard.\n\n\
  From the [http://www.guildwars.com/theworld/heroes/ official website] and manual:\n\
  :''Dedicated Bodyguard''\n\
  ::''\"The prince likes to give orders. I like to take orders. It's a good life.\"''\n\n\
  :'''Origin:''' [[Vabbi]]\n\
  :'''Age:''' 28\n\
  :'''Profession:''' [[Warrior]]\n\n\
  :''Goren is big. Goren is strong. Goren is really, really good at sprinting into battle. Unfortunately, Goren isn't exactly the sharpest blade in the armory. He understands everyday conversation, and he can carry out simple commands \xE2\x80\x93 particularly sentences with the words \"hit\" and \"smash\" in them \xE2\x80\x93 but the finer philosophical passages of the [[Flameseeker Prophecies]] will remain eternally outside his comprehension. Eager for work, Goren has found employment working as the bodyguard of [[Prince Bokka the Magnificent]]. Money and influence don't mean much to him, though. Loyalty does.''\n\n\

  Complete the quest [[Goren's Stuff: Part 1]] to gain Goren. The quest is only available after completing the quest [[Brains or Brawn]] by selecting [[Norgu]].

  ==Armor==\n\
  Goren starts with basic Vabbian Armor. \n\n\
  The appearance of his armor can be upgraded to [[Ancient armor]] using [[Mysterious Armor Piece]]s acquired from [[the Shadow Nexus]] [[Challenge Mission]]. The appearance of his armor can also be upgraded to [[Primeval armor]] using [[Primeval Armor Remnants]] acquired in the [[Domain of Anguish]] and during [[the Ebony Citadel of Mallyx]] mission.\n\n\
  ==Dialogue==\n\
  In most Vabbi areas:\n\
  :''\"The boss says to stand here and guard. I better not move or he'll get angry.\"''\n\n\
  During [[Brains or Brawn]] and [[Goren's Stuff: Part 1]]:\n\
  :''\"Wait, what? Oh! Hi! Did you need protection? Want me to hit something? Need a backrub? Whatever you want, boss. Prince Bokka said I was the best bodyguard to ever work for him. But I think he just said that because he wasn't dead. I mean, I guess that's good, right?\n\n\
  During the Dasha Vestibule mission:\n\
  :''\"I hope Prince Bokka will be happy to see me.\"''\n\n\
  In Throne of Secrets:\n\
  :''\"Ahai, hero! I want to be just like you!\"''\n\n\

  The Shining Blade's plan to reassemble the portal to the Henge of Denravi has been betrayed to the White Mantle, who have been slaughtering all who stood in their way as they try to claim it. Should the Shining Blade succeed, they will gain a new, hidden base of operations to strike back at the Mantle. Fail, and not only will the Henge be lost to the Shining Blade, but their resistance movement will collapse as well.\n\n\
  ==Mission information==\n\n\
  ===Objectives===\n\
  * Get to the Henge Portal\n\
  * Attune the Henge Portal before the White Mantle do it.\n\
  * '''Added''' Attune the Thorn Pedestal to clear the vine gate.\n\
  * '''Added''' Attune both thorn Pedestals to clear the vine gate.\n\
  * '''Added''' Kill the Henge Guardian\n\
  * '''Bonus''' Assassinate the Demagogue.\n\n\
  ==Walkthrough==\n\
  ===Introduction===\n\
  The first third of this mission is a straigh out hack and slash through various monsters and bosses, the same ones that you've encountered throughout the Maguuma Jungle (Maguuma Spiders, Jungle Trolls, etc.). The mission actually starts to change once you encounter the Druids and the first few Thorn Pedestals, as you now are introduced to what you need to do to complete the mission.\n\n\
  Each thorn pedestal that is next to a Druid has a crystal on it that you grab and take to another thorn pedestal. Doing so attunes the pedestal to your party. If a crystal isn't in the pedestal, click on the druid to have it put one in. Keep in mind that, when carrying the crystals, you cannot use, or gain any bonuses, from your weapons or offhand items. Dropping the crystal breaks it, which means you will need to go back to the original pedestal and pick up another one.\n\n\
  As you make your way through the While Mantle, you'll eventually come to a point where you must attune the three pedestals before the mantle does. Just as the mission objective suggests, it's a race to see who can attune all three crystals first, and the White Mantle start with the pedestal on the right claimed by them, and a party will be approaching to take the one on the left. There are several ways that you can go about this, depending on your style of play and whether your party consists of heroes/henchies, other players, or a mix of both.\n\n\
  ===Method 1: Holding the middle ground.===\n\n\
  This method is the riskiest way to do it, but there's only one way the game will make them go, forcing them to break your line. Let the mantle claim the right and left pedestals, and hold the center pathway between the center platform and the pedestal closest to the druid. The White Mantle will come straight down the center and run into you. At this point you can use snare spells and skills to trap the runner and pound him/her into oblivion. Keep in mind, though, that when you kill the runner, another party will venture out from their base and come down the same way. If you're not able to eliminate their groups fast enough, you may get overwhelmed and/or the runner will break your line and take the last pedestal, making you fail the mission.\n\n\
  It is recommended that you make your stand on the center pathway, as it is the narrowest area and makes trapping the runner more effective. Also, the White Mantle Abbots can remove hexes using [[Convert Hexes]], so having more than one party member carrying a snare skill can help to overcome this. See below for some suggested skills.\n\n\
  ===Method 2: Running the crystals===\n\n\
  You can complete this objective without wiping out the entire White Mantle contingent by simply taking a crystal to each of the three pedestals. Keep in mind that when you do this, you should have some speed buffs in your skillbar to allow you to outrun the White Mantle teams; Each time they claim a pedestal, another team immediately heads out to claim the next. To make sure that the Mantle don't claim all three pedestals before you can, you can have other party members defending a pedestal or running other crystals. Just remember to keep at least one pedestal claimed to avoid failing the mission.\n\n\
  You should have two or three players standing by the druid and the crystals. One player should pick up a crystal and run to the nearest thorn pedestal. As soon as it is set in place, a new crystal will spawn, which the second player should grab and head to the next pedestal. If you only have two runners, the first runner should return to the crystal spawnpoint while the second runner is out. Either way, once the crystal spawns again, repeat the process. If this is coordinated properly, you should have no trouble at all.\n\n\
  When you finally claim all three pedestals, a cut scene will play showing your party being teleported to the Henge. Make your way through the token resistance there, and you will fight the [[Henge Guardian]]. He is flanked by two [[Root Behemoth]]'s that can pick away at your party if they're not eliminated before taking out the [[Henge Guardian]]. When you take out all three of them, the mission ends.\n\n\
  ===Bonus===\n\
  Just before you enter the area with the three pedestals, you will see a Shining Blade warrior named [[Less Longbow]] being engaged by two White Mantle Knights. You must kill both of the knights before they murder him. Once this is done, he'll speak a few lines, and add the bonus to your objective list.\n\n\
  The Demagogue is located in a garrison on the other side of the area with the three pedestals. The same troops that make up that station are also the ones that will try to run the crystals out to claim the pedestals. You will need to take out these troops before you can even get close to The Demagogue. Once dispatched, he'll be standing off all by his lonesome self inside their base - dispatch him with ease.\n\n\
  Note - By doing the above-listed Method 1, you will eventually engage all the garrison's troops. If you defeat them all there, the Demagogue will be undefended.\n\n\
  Another method for those not in the mood to cut their way through the Mantle is to head to the pedestal on the far right from the entrance, where you will find a path that leads past the bulk of his forces. From there, provided you hug the side furthest from them you can eliminate the Demagogue and if you're lucky, his troops won't notice. Easy.\n\n\

  ==Notes==\n\
  * Though the mission makes it seem otherwise, [[The Demagogue]] is '''not''' a boss.\n\
  * [[White Mantle Seeker]]s use the skill [[Dryder's Defenses]] when under fire to block attacks. This can make it difficult to hit them if they're carrying the crystals. Use stance-breaker skills to end it, or use snaring hexes to slow them down.\n\n\

  As a monk you receive [[Orison of Healing]] and [[Bane Signet]] after you are resurrected at the resurrection shrine.\n\n\
  ==Dialogue==\n\
  ===Initial dialogue===\n\
  '''Instructor Ng'''\n\
  :''\"For this quest, I need your aid in clearing the training grounds here of some annoying '''mantid hatchlings''' that have infested the place. But before you can help me, you must formally accept the quest. Please accept this quest now.\"''\n\
  :'''Accept:''' ''\"I'm happy to help.\"''\n\
  :'''Decline:''' ''\"I don't think so.\"''\n\
  :'''When asked about quest:''' ''\"We must go out and destroy those remaining '''hatchlings''' before you can move forward with your training. You do want to enter the monastery, I assume....\"''\n\n\
  ===Intermediate dialogue===\n\
  :'''Instructor Ng:''' ''\"Now that you have accepted the quest, it appears in your Quest Log. To view your Quest Log, click the Menu button in the lower left corner of the screen, and select Quest Log.\"''\n\
  :'''Instructor Ng:''' ''\"You can also view your Quest Log by press the \"L\" key.\"''\n\
  :'''Instructor Ng:''' ''\"<player name>, whenever you are ready to continue your training, left-click me and we will continue.\"''\n\
  :'''Instructor Ng:''' ''\"The Quest Log contains information about quests you have accepted but have not yet completed. This information includes specific steps for completing the quest as well as a summary of the quest objective.\"''\n\
  :'''Instructor Ng:''' ''\"Do you see the green starburst on your mini-map? That shows you the location of the next step on your currently selected quest.\"''\n\
  :'''Kisai:''' ''\"Please excuse my interruption, Instructor Ng, but what happens if the goal is not within the scope of the mini-map?\"''\n\
  :'''Instructor Ng:''' ''\"A good question, Kisai. If the next step is far away, a green arrow in the mini-map will point you in the general direction of your goal. Any other questions?\"''\n\
  :'''Kisai:''' ''\"Oh, yes, sir! Are mantid hatchlings very large? What do they look like? How fearsome are they? What do they...\"''\n\
  :'''Instructor Ng:''' ''\"I think those questions will be best answered by seeing one in the flesh, Kisai. Meet me at the gate when you are ready, and we will go and find some.\"''\n\
  :'''Instructor Ng:''' ''\"Through these gates are a number of vicious, bloodthirsty, flesh-eating mantid hatchlings. I will let you face the first one on your own so I can observe your combat technique.\"''\n\
  :'''Kisai:''' ''\"Suddenly, I am not feeling well...\"''\n\
  :'''Instructor Ng:''' ''\"Do you see that mantid hatchling up ahead? Simply left-click it to begin your attack. Kisai and Mai, stand fast, please. I want to see how <player name> handles the situation.\"''\n\
  :'''Kisai:''' ''\"I would not even know how to begin. I will leave it up to <player name>!\"''\n\
  :'''Mai:''' ''\"As you wish, Instructor Ng.\"''\n\
  :'''Instructor Ng:''' ''\"When defeated, creatures drop whatever they are carrying: gold, weapons, and so on. If you are in a group, any gold is divided evenly among group members, while items are randomly assigned to a single group member.\"''\n\
  :'''Instructor Ng:''' ''\"Now, keep moving forward. This time, Kisai and Mai will help you. Remember: however mighty we may become, we must rely on our allies for support.\"''\n\
  :'''Mai:''' ''\"Let us fight with honor.\"''\n\
  :'''Kisai:''' ''\"I will do my best.\"''\n\
  :'''Instructor Ng:''' ''\"Good work, students. Now, if you will step inside the gate to the next area, we will talk about...death.\"''\n\
  :'''Instructor Ng:''' ''\"<player name>, whenever you are ready to continue your training, left-click me and we will continue.\"''\n\
  :'''Instructor Ng:''' ''\"You did very well against those hatchlings, but there will likely be times when things do not go in your favor. Kisai, Mai, <player name>: follow me to the resurrection shrine, please.\"''\n\
  :'''Kisai:''' ''\"I have a bad feeling about this.\"''\n\
  :'''Instructor Ng:''' ''\"<player name>, whenever you are ready to continue your training, left-click me and we will continue.\"''\n\
  :'''Instructor Ng:''' ''\"Resurrection Shrines become active as you near them. If you die, you will be resurrected at the nearest active shrine. You will know that a shrine is active by the glow emanating from it.\"''\n\
  :'''Instructor Ng:''' ''\"Do not worry overmuch, students. Thanks to the resurrection shrine, you will be back soon enough.\"''\n\
  :'''Kisai:''' ''\"With such a powerful tool at our disposal, we will have little to fear in combat!\"''\n\
  :'''Instructor Ng:''' ''\"Do not become overconfident, Kisai. You may have noticed a box in the upper left-hand corner of your screen that reads \"-15%\". This is called a Dealth Penalty.\"''\n\
  :'''Instructor Ng:''' ''\"Each time you die, your maximum Health and Energy are reduced. The limit for this Death Penalty is -60%, which can be quite harsh when you are attempting to battle a difficult foe.\"''\n\
  :'''Mai:''' ''\"Is there no remedy for this Death Penalty?\"''\n\
  :'''Instructor Ng:''' ''\"As you defeat foes in combat, you will reduce your Death Penalty. Also, visiting a town or other place of rest will fully eliminate your Death Penalty.\"''\n\
  :'''Mai:''' ''\"And if there are no resurrection shrines in the area?\"''\n\
  :'''Instructor Ng:''' ''\"At times you may undertake dangerous missions that have no resurrection shrines. In such cases, death will require you to restart the mission from the beginning.\"''\n\
  :'''Instructor Ng:''' ''\"It is possible to learn skills to resurrect fallen companions. But first we should concentrate on skills that will keep you alive.\"''\n\
  :'''Instructor Ng:''' ''\"Skills produce a variety of effects, from healing your allies to damaging your foes to allowing you to run more quickly. Using skills effectively is often the key to victory.\"''\n\
  :'''Instructor Ng:''' ''\"I have just given each of you two basic skills from your chosen profession. They should now be equipped in your Skill Bar at the bottom of your screen. To activate a skill, simply left-click it.\"''\n\
  :'''Mai:''' ''\"We can also press the \"1\" through \"8\" keys to activate the corresponding skill, is that right Instructor Ng?\"''\n\
  :'''Instructor Ng:''' ''\"Just so, Mai.\"''\n\
  :'''Instructor Ng:''' ''\"Now that you are suitably prepared for combat, let us go and finish clearing out those mantid hatchlings. Meet me at the gate when you are ready.\"''\n\
  :'''Instructor Ng:''' ''\"<player name>, whenever you are ready to continue your training, left-click me and we will continue.\"''\n\
  :'''Instructor Ng:''' ''\"Stop here, and look at your mini-map. You are the green dot in the middle. See the white circle around you? Any aggressive enemy that enters this \"Danger Zone\" will notice you and become hostile.\"''\n\
  :'''Kisai:''' ''\"Oh! So...those red dots on the mini-map are enemies, right? I was wondering about that.\"''\n\
  :'''Instructor Ng:''' ''\"You are correct, Kisai. Students, proceed.\"''\n\
  :'''Instructor Ng:''' ''\"Be careful, <player name>! Remember to watch your Health and use your healing skills when you are wounded.\"''\n\
  :'''Instructor Ng:''' ''\"Very good, students! You are doing well!\"''\n\
  :'''Instructor Ng:''' ''\"That was the last of them. Now that you have completed your quest, come speak to me for a reward.\"''\n\n\
  ===Reward dialogue===\n\
  '''Instructor Ng'''\n\
  :''\"Excellent work, <player name>! I will explain a few last things, and then I believe you are ready to enter the monastery.\"''"

  ==In-game description==
  This beautiful cove is said to be the home to the best fishing in all of [[Kryta]]. Legends tell of a time when the fish were so plentiful here that one had only to skim the surface with a net to take in the equivalent of a full day's catch from any other body of water. Whether the legends be true or not, Krytan fishermen, both professional and casual, can often be found on the shores of [[Fishermen's Haven]].

  ==Walkthrough==\n\
  After talking with [[Damaris]] (just outside of [[Lion's Arch]]), speak with Devona to recieve a marker to the whereabouts of the settlement. Mhenlo, Cynn, Devona and Aidan will begin to follow you. Initially head west and cross the bridge, then follow the path north. When you reach a fork in the road, head northwest. Keep to the path to avoid conflict with the [[Tengu]] in this large area. At the next split head right and continue following the paths north and then north west until you reach the settlement at the northwest corner of the [[North Kryta Province]]. When you approach Captain Greywind the 4 allies will depart and the second objective will be complete. Then simply talk to the Captain.\n\n\
  ==Dialogue==\n\
  ===Initial Dialogue===\n\
  '''Damaris'''\n\

  :''\"We should get going. The sooner we can get to the settlement, the better. I hear Captain Greywind is overseeing things, so we should check with him when we get there. Lead the way, <player name>, and we'll follow.\"''\n\
  ===Reward Dialogue===\n\
  '''Captain Greywind'''\n\
  :''\"Welcome to our new home. I can't help but think that it's tragic for us to have fought so hard and come so far only to land in a place like this. Ettins and Tengu assault us from all sides, not to mention those skale and imps. To make matters worse, we are lacking in all but the most basic supplies.

  ==Notes==
  * Note that while Dark Aura deals more damage with more ranks in death magic, you also lose more health.
  * [[Blood Renewal]], [[Generous Was Tsungrai]], and [[Spirit Light]] (or a combination therof), are  useful ways of healing to balance out Dark Aura's health loss while still dealing damage through sacrifice. In particular [[Spirit Light]] has the combined advantage of low energy cost, fast recharge time and instant healing, which allows for sustainable healing (and damage) over time.
  * If triggered too rapidly in PvE, monsters will flee the [[AoE]].
  * Combine Dark Aura with touch or point-blank skills that require sacrifices such as [[Signet of Agony]] and [[Touch of Agony]].  Other sacrifice skills, touch skills, or point-blank skills may also work well.

  The [[Lich Lord|Lich]] is revealed, and now you must stop him before he unleashes his [[titan]] army across all of [[Tyria]]. Seek the Lich and destroy him!
  
  ==Objectives==
  Stop the Lich from destroying the world.
  * Disable the Titan Portals.
  * Defeat Undead Rurik.
  * Destroy the Lich.
  * '''Bonus''' Destroy all three [[Armageddon Lord]]s.
  
  ==Skill recommendations==
  *Most Titans are not fleshy and thus immune to [[Bleeding]], [[Poison]], and [[Disease]]. These Titans will also not leave a corpse. Carefully consider leaving out skills that utilize these conditions or corpses.
  *Titans are believed to have high armor against [[Fire damage|fire]]. If bringing [[elemental damage]], bring a ranger with [[Winter]] to convert the damage to [[Cold damage|cold]]. 
  *The elite skill [[Greater Conflagration]] can be [[Signet of Capture|capped]] in this mission, and works very well when combined with Winter to convert ''all'' damage dealt to cold. 
  *To further the efficiency of cold damage vs. the Titans, consider bringing weapons with a damage type conversion mod, or preparations such as [[Kindle Arrows]].
  *[[Extinguish]] may help alleviate the [[Burning]] caused by being adjacent some titans. However, Burning will be reapplied if players remain adjacent to the titan.
  *[[Rust]] will leave the Hands and Fists open while they use [[Healing Signet]]. Often, they can be defeated before completing activation due to the double damage.
  
  ==Walkthrough==
  Titans have the unique attribute that upon their death, some will give rise to a new titan (or multiple titans) in their place. Thus it is imperative that players know what targets to prioritize and focus on one at a time. For this mission, know that [[Burning Titan]]s are reborn as [[Risen Ashen Hulk]]s. The Ashen Hulks further are reborn as a [[Hand of the Titan]] and a [[Fist of the Titan]]. Hands and Fists are not reborn into anything. Also, being adjacent to Burning Titans or Risen Ashen Hulks will apply Burning to players. Imps called [[Spark of the Titan]] join the titans groups and can deal massive area fire damage. Luckily, they are not reborn.
  
  The first group gives you a taste of what fighting titans is like. Although you see a mere two titans, you'll quickly notice how much trouble they can cause when reborn. In general, the Risen Ashen Hulks are the least dangerous, so focus on the Burning Titan. Now you'll have two Ash Hulks. Focus on one and wait for it to give rise to the Hand and Fist pair. Dispatch these before moving on to the other Ash Hulk.
  
  Proceeding down the path, you'll see the Lich, but he will disappear, replaced with a level 1 [[Quickening Zephyr]]. You'll run into more titans. Take them out as you did the first two, focusing on one at a time to help control what spawns you face. At this point, you can continue south or across the bridge to the east. Both paths rejoin eventually. You'll also run into the Sparks which should be the priority target as their fire spells can quickly wreck havoc on your party's health. If you want to initiate the bonus, head to the Seer in the southeast. To continue with the mission, follow the path southwest. You'll run across the Lich again, and he'll repeat the disappearing act as before. The path will wrap around to the north and open into a large open area with three portals.
  
  If you initiated the bonus, you'll see the three Armageddon Lords in the lava to the east. You'll also see a patrol of titans, a spark, and a titan boss along the western half where the portals are. Leave all these alone for now. Take out isolated foes that are scattered across the field while taking out spawns that emerge from the lava. Eventually, after two bosses have spawned out of the lava, the spawns will cease and it is safe to continue on. If doing the bonus, pull the Armageddon Lords out of the lava and dispatch them one at a time. When ready, pull the patrol away from the portals and take them out as well. At this time, all that should be left are the portals and the three defending wraiths around each one. Take out each group one at a time to continue. Optimally, you can avoid the patrol and time your attacks to take out the wraith groups before the patrol comes back.
  
  After the cutscene, pull out the groups of Fists if you can to dispatch them without drawing in Rurik as well. If you let the cutscene run (ie. not skipping it), Rurik should be further back, making it easier to lure the Fists towards you. If you can't get to the rightmost group of Fists, try to pull the Sparks and Rurik to the left. Dispose of the Sparks first before finishing off Rurik.
  
  Follow the path to find the Lich Lord waiting for you upon a bloodstone. This time, he does not disappear. Try to take out Hands and Fists as you can to isolate the Lich. He will occasionally teleport a party member into the lava or teleport there himself. Otherwise, he has little more then strong attacks. When his health it depleted, sometimes it restores entirely. There are numerous theories about if the Lich must be standing on a particular part of the bloodstone to prevent this restoration, but the exact mechanics are still unknown. Eventually, the Lich will go down and not come back up. Congratulations, you have completed the final mission of the Prophecies campaign!
  
  ===Bonus===
  To initiate the bonus, you must first talk to the [[Ancient Seer]] along the southeastern portion of the map. A Burning Titan and a spark patrol roam near him. These groups WILL attack the Seer and the Seer WILL move to engage them. However they do not appear to interact until you have them on your radar, at which point you will need to quickly kill whatever group is blocking your path to the Seer. Once you have initiated the bonus, it no longer matters whether or not the Seer lives. If you took the eastern path across the bridge, you'll likely come from the north. If you continued south earlier, you need to head east once you reach the path containing Spark patrols and will come up from the south to find the Seer.
  
  Once you talk with the Seer, the Armageddon Lords will spawn in the lava by the portals. It's best to let the spawns cease before attempting to lure the Lords in, otherwise you might unexpectedly be battling both the Armageddon Lord and a titan boss. A longbow should be sufficient enough to lure each Armageddon Lord one by one out of the lava where it can be safely dispatched. Be aware that they will be reborn into Risen Ashen Hulks after they are defeated. Defeat all three to gain the bonus.

Junundu: "{{npc-stub}}\n\
  __NOTOC__{{NPC infobox \n\
  | species = Junundu\n\
  | campaign = Nightfall\n\
  }} \n\n\
  Colossal wurms roam the sulfurous wastelands of [[the Desolation]]. These burrowers tunnel through soft soil with amazing alacrity. Elonians know them by their more formal name: the [[Junundu]]. According to historians, the undead lord [[Palawa Joko]] commanded these wurms to patrol his kingdom, but the junundu\xE2\x80\x99s inability to tunnel through solid rock limited their usefulness. Myths tell of great [[hero]]es using junundu to travel across the wastelands, covering vast distances safe from the sulfuric clouds. More recent accounts  describe devastating wails and thunderous attacks that shake the very earth and topple buildings in their wake.\n\n\
  According to legend, junundu society is developed enough that they act in service to a queen mother: a subterranean monstrosity\n\
  called [[Queen Aijundu|Aijundu]]. Lurking below, Queen Aijundu patiently waits for foolish surfacedwellers who would dare to cross her apocalyptic domain. As long as wind shifts the desert sands, some say, she will lie beneath it...waiting.\n\n\
  {{bug|Sometimes [[hero]]es and [[henchmen]] will exit their Junundu in the middle of the [[Sulfurous Haze]], killing themselves and preventing their resurrection through [[Junundu Wail]].}}\n\n\
  ==Skills Used==\n\
  #{{skill icon|Junundu Strike}}\n\
  #{{skill icon|Junundu Smash}}\n\
  #{{skill icon|Junundu Bite}}\n\

  #*{{skill icon|Unknown Junundu Ability}} ([[elite]])\n\

  #{{skill icon|Junundu Wail}}\n\
  #{{skill icon|Leave Junundu}}\n\n\n\
  The Junundu skills will replace all skills of the character inside, except [[Signet of Capture|Signets of Capture]]. The Signets of Capture will still be usable inside the wurm (and the corresponding wurm skill will not be). When capturing a skill while riding a Junundu, the newly captured skill will be replaced by the corresponding Junundu skill. As a result, players cannot use any skills other than Junundu skills while riding a Junundu.\n\n\
  ==Notes==\n\
  * Make sure you do not place your [[Signet of Capture]] in Skill slot number 7. If you do, when you enter the Junundu, the [[Signet of Capture]] will remain usable but will cover the [[Junundu Wail]] skill. Check your skill bar the first time you enter the Junundu to see if there are any skills covered you want to be able to use. If so, zone to an outpost and adjust your build. Generally, a good skill to replace is Unknown Junundu Ability (if you do not have Junundu Siege yet) or Junundu Tunnel (which henchmen will not use, making you more vulnerable to enemies before they can catch up).\n\
  * Junundu are summoned by using a [[Wurm Spoor]]. You cannot do this if there are foes within a certain radius of the spoor.\n\
  * A Junundu is summoned with 3,000 [[Health]] and 60 [[Energy]] regardless of the level, profession, or equipment of the character controlling it. Characters in Junundu form are known to have 28 less [[AL]] against [[Earth damage]], they are also known to have a decreased AL against most or all damage types, however the exact values are unknown.\n\
  ** The Junundu has the same [[energy recovery]] of the character inside. Equipped items with Energy regeneration -1 will affect the Junundu.\n\
  ** Only bonus modifiers - [[rune]]s, [[weapon modifier]]s, [[weapon upgrade]]s, and [[insignia]]s - affect the maximum [[Health]] and [[Energy]], not the base bonuses such as base Energy bonuses on stave's and focus items or base Energy bonuses on armor.\n\
  ** Alternating between different weapon sets or re-equipping an armor piece that has a [[rune]] applied affects the maximum [[Health]] and [[Energy]] of the wurm.\n\
  ** Since they give constant health and armor, wurms make a great way to power level heroes.\n\
  ** A Junundu's regular attacks do a flat amount of armor ignoring damage, dependent on weapon type.\n\
  *** Swords, hammers, and axes inflict 55 damage per hit.\n\
  *** Daggers inflict 40 damage per hit with a chance to double strike.\n\
  *** Scythes inflict 35 damage per hit and can hit one adjacent secondary target.\n\
  *** Bows inflict 40 damage per hit and have a ranged attack, range varies with bow type.\n\
  *** Spears inflict 55 damage per hit and have a ranged attack.\n\
  *** Wands and stave's inflict 40 damage per hit and have a ranged attack.\n\
  ** The damage type of the Junundu's weapon is the same as the damage type of the weapon the character is holding. Wielding a [[Smiting Rod]] or [[Smiting Staff]] will allow your Junundu to deal double damage against undead for its normal attacks.\n\
  * When controlling a Junundu, the character's [[primary attribute]] is reduced to zero.\n\
  * [[Death Penalty]] does not affect the wurm, but will affect the character inside once that character leaves the wurm.\n\
  * Junundu are immune to the [[Sulfurous Haze]] environment effect.\n\
  * Junundu cannot tunnel through rocky terrain. Trying to do so will cause the wurm to release the character controlling it, similar to as if the skill [[Leave Junundu]] was used.\n\n\
  ==Trivia==\n\
  *Junundu models respond to some emote commands:\n\
  **/dance : The Junundu wiggles from side to side.\n\
  **/sit or /afk : The Junundu burrows in the sand.\n\
  **/stand : Just the /sit animation backwards.\n\
  **/roar : The Junundu performs the [[Junundu Wail]] animation. Sometimes with sound. This one is quite impressive with a full AI party, since all will /roar with you.\n\
  **/salute : some Junundu will turn towards you."

  ==Walkthrough==\n\
  Head roughly south-west towards the pool of water to find the Rogue Bull. If you are a ranged combatant, use [[Imagined Burden]] to slow the bull down while you attack it. The Rogue Bull has a fair amount of armor, so armor ignoring skills, like [[Conjure Phantasm]], are useful. Beware of the Rogue Bull's skill, [[Bull's Charge]], as this can cause [[knock down]], particularly if you are attempting to flee. Bring healing or come with a friend or pet if you are of a low level. Whatever you do, try to keep the Rogue Bull away from you as long as possible, because [[Bull's Charge]] can get annoying. From a distance, click on the Rogue Bull so that whenever you're not using skills on the Rogue Bull, you'll attack it. Then use [[Imagined Burden]]. If done right, [[Imagined Burden]] will not be cast immediately; instead, your character will move just close enough to the Rogue Bull to be able to use skills on it or attack it. This distance is the maximum distance between you and the Rogue Bull. After you use [[Imagined Burden]] on it, the Rogue Bull will notice you and start moving towards you. Use [[Conjure Phantasm]] to damage the Rogue Bull as much as possible before it gets to you. In between [[Conjure Phantasm]]s, attack or use other skills. After the Rogue Bull is dead, simply go back the way you came for your reward.\n\n\

I sent villagers to excavate these tablets for me, but alas, they unearthed only magical beings made of clay. I believe that these enchanted clay creatures hold shards of the orrian tablets within themselves. I need heroes such as you to defeat these creatures and return to me the '''Orrian tablet shards''' contained within. Bring me 5 shards that I may continue my research.\n\n\

Maxed titles rank: "{{Title infobox\n\
  | campaign = Core\n\

  ===Maxed titles rank title track===\n\
  :{| {{STDT}} cellpadding=\"5\"\n\
  ! Tier !! Title !! Maxed title tracks\n\
  |- align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"\n\
  | '''1''' || '''Kind Of A Big Deal''' || '''5'''\n\

  |- align=\"center\" valign=\"top\"\n\
  | 3 || I'm Very Important|| 15*\n\
  |}\n\n\
  ''<nowiki>*</nowiki> Currently, any number of maxed titles beyond 15 will still display rank 3 \"I'm Very Important.\"''\n\n\
  ==Acquisition==\n\
  The completion of this title track is an indirect process. Progress is made by completing ''other'' title tracks. Each separate title track (i.e. separate bars on the [[Hero Panel]]) will contribute one point to this title track.\n\n\
  ===Available title tracks===\n\
  It is currently possible to reach a maximum of 30 completed title tracks on a character, from a choice of 31 (due to mutual exclusivities):\n\n\
  * Experience & skill based titles\n\
  **1 Either [[Defender of Ascalon]] or [[Survivor|Legendary Survivor]] (mutually exclusive)\n\
  **4 [[Skill Hunter|Elite Skill Hunter titles]] (Tyria, Cantha, Elona, [[Legendary Skill Hunter|Legendary]])\n\n\
  *15 mission and exploration titles\n\
  **3 [[Protector|Protector titles]] (Tyria, Cantha, Elona)\n\
  **4 [[Guardian (title)|Guardian titles]] (Tyria, Cantha, Elona, [[Legendary Guardian|Legendary]])\n\
  **4 [[Vanquisher|Vanquisher titles]] (Tyria, Cantha, Elona, [[Legendary Vanquisher|Legendary]])\n\
  **4 [[Cartographer|Grandmaster Cartographer titles]] (Tyria, Cantha, Elona, [[Legendary Cartographer|Legendary]])\n\n\
  *4 allegiance or faction titles\n\
  **2 Allegiance: [[Allegiance rank|Savior of the Kurzicks]] & [[Allegiance rank|Savior of the Luxons]]\n\
  **1 [[Lightbringer rank|Holy Lightbringer]]\n\
  **1 [[Sunspear rank|Legendary Spearmarshal]]\n\n\
  *6 activity titles\n\
  **1 [[Drunkard|Incorrigible Ale-Hound]]\n\
  **1 [[Sweet Tooth|Connoisseur of Confectionaries]]\n\
  **1 [[Treasure Hunter|Grand Master Treasure Hunter]]\n\
  **1 [[Wisdom|Source of Wisdom]]\n\
  **2 Lucks: [[Lucky|Lucky]] & [[Lucky|Unlucky]]\n\n\
  *0 PvP titles: PvP titles are currently either not maxable or their ceilings are too high to be considered for ranks in the Maxed titles.\n\n\
  ===Title track synergies===\n\
  The following groups of title tracks go well together:\n\
  ;Survivor, Skill Hunter, Protector: Being careful not to die, it is possible even with henchmen to capture many elites and complete many missions with masters rewards, which makes it a fun and fast way to achieve the Survivor title. Keep the hard missions and elites for after you have completed the Survivor title.\n\
  ;Vanquisher and Cartographer: Both titles require you to fully cover explorable areas, making the Cartographer titles almost free for Vanquishers.\n\
  ;Allegiance, Treasure Hunter, Wisdom: Find a spot with [[Bounty|bounties]] or repeatable [[quest]]s that also have [[chest]]s scattered along the way. \n\
  ;Allegiance, Activity, Skill Hunter: Use allegiance titles in [[hard mode]] (for Vanquisher and Guardian) to finance activity and Skill Hunter titles.\n\
  ;Drunkard & Lucky/Unlucky: Get your tickets, stand in the circles, and drink!\n\
  ;Allegiance and Survivor: Use repeatable faction farming quests to gain experience for your survivor. In some cases, farming is more optimal with dying, in which case take the role of \"The Doorman\".\n\
  ;Gamer & Sweet tooth/Drunkard: Use the gamer rewards to get more sweets & drinks. Note that Gamer title is not currently known to be maxable.\n\n\
  ==Notes==\n\
  *The titles names are all lines from the movie [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0357413/quotes \"Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy\"].\n\
  *On beta testing servers the next tiers for this title are: I Have Many Leather-Bound Books (4) and My Apartment Smells of Rich Mahogany (5). These tiers have not been seen on the live servers and may be subject to changes but do make sense following on from the three that are known."

  }}\n\
  After this mission, players will be in [[Yak's Bend]].\n\n\
  ==Mission information==\n\n\
  ===Objectives===\n\
  Return [[Prince Rurik]] south of the Wall to safety.\n\n\
  * Sneak out and ambush the [[Charr]] forces besieging the academy. \n\
  * Return to the [[Nolani Academy]] to rendezvous with the prince. \n\
  * Defend Prince Rurik on the way back to the capital city of Rin. \n\
  * '''BONUS''' Return the [[Tome of the Fallen]].\n\
  * '''ADDED''' Take [[Stormcaller]] to [[Horn Hill]]. \n\
  * '''ADDED''' Save Rin.\n\n\
  ==Walkthrough==\n\
  In order to avoid being totally overpowered by the Charr outside the academy, do not pull the lever. Instead, take the back exit (north-east then head roughly south from there). Make your way through various groups of enemies until you reach part of [[The Wall]]. From here, turn northward until you find yourself behind the Charr army that is still camped outside the academy. Work your way through them, small group by small group.  There will be a random Charr boss in the middle of the army. After you kill the Charr, Prince Rurik will pull the lever inside himself and greet you. Follow him back to The Wall, and watch the cutscene.\n\n\
  After the cutscene, follow Rurik (he will run ahead thoughtlessly at this point). Though he is a capable tank, you should hurry so that he is not overwhelmed by the [[elemental]]s. Following the next cutscene, you will meet another large group of Charr. Most of them can be avoided but when you do fight some, you'll find that Stormcaller's effect has greatly weakened all of the Charr. Follow Rurik into the city, fighting various Charr along the way until you come to [[Bonfaaz Burntfur]]. Kill him to finish the mission.\n\n\
  === Bonus ===\n\
  You get this bonus fairly early in the mission by exploring east before reaching the wall (1 on the map). There is a \"green dot\" there (Watchman Pramas), who will give you the bonus and drop the \"[[Tome of the Fallen]]\". Get a caster to pick this up and carry it (casters make the best carriers of items because they don't rely on melee attacks to do damage).\n\n\
  Continue south and head towards the wall. Go down the stairs, do not cross the gate, but continue all the way west instead. Keep left and pass west up the hill. Here it can get very nasty, especially if you have a bad group where folks rush ahead. If someone rushes ahead, you will get mobbed and the group will probably wipe. First, explore the area surrounding the Spirits of the Fallen carefully, as there are a lot of groups of hidden level 8 [[Devourer]]s there. Once cleared, you have somewhere safe to take on the Spirits of the Fallen. Lure out the warriors as few at a time as possible. Done badly, you will get 8-10 level 10 warriors, and it gets very nasty; done carefully, with luck you will only get 3-4 at a time. After 10 or so are dead, it is safe to get closer to the pedestal. Replace the tome on the pedestal, and talk to the ghost [[Old Ascalon Spirit]] (point 2 on the map). That will make the ghosts disappear and get you the bonus.\n\n\
  If you can, try heading up the left-hand entrance and sidle up against the wall there. Often it results in having to fight groups of only 2-3 at most.\n\n\
  Note: Placing the tome on the pedestal will not instantly make the ghosts disappear. Any that are already attacking your group will do so for long enough to cause serious trouble. So, make sure not to draw the attention of more ghosts when approaching the pedestal. Alternatively, have someone who has equipped a skill that allows faster movement (e.g., [[Sprint]] or [[Dodge]]) place the tome, and have them get out quickly once it's placed.\n\n\
  Notes: \n\
  *[[Holy damage]] is very effective against the Spirits of the Fallen.\n\
  *A few pairs of the spirits will not move to attack you, even when in [[aggro]] range; they only attack if you are within melee range. Use this to your advantage and take them out with ranged attacks and spells. They will move if attacked by AoE [[spell]]s but will then move back to their original location.\n\
  *The [[Devourer]] boss off in the Northeast corner by the cemetery can provide a recharge for [[Resurrection Signet]]s. Be careful and try to lure him because several [[Carrion Devourer]]s will appear when you attack.\n\n\

  ==Notes==\n\
  *Complete exploration of this mission contributes approximately 1.0% to the Tyrian [[Cartographer]] title.\n\
  *If you are uninterested in completing the bonus and have a very well-organized team, you can pull the lever yourself and fight the Charr that swarm in.  You will, though, miss out on quite a bit of area that can be explored, and it is almost impossible to acquire the bonus objective.\n\
  *Before [[Guild Wars Factions| Factions]] came out, Prince Rurik would not pull the initial lever himself, whether the Charr outside were killed or not.  If a party didn't want to split themselves by leaving one person inside the fortress or wait while a runner ran all the way back around, the party had to pull the lever. Back then, this was the typical method of completing the mission as Rurik would not trigger the first cutscene himself.\n\n\

  For 90 seconds, you deal 25% more damage but have 25% less Health.
  
  ==Notes==
  "Victory or Death!" is a [[skill]] used by [[NPC]]s after the 20 minute mark in a GvG match. It has unlimited range and gives everyone +25% damage and -25% health. When this occurs, all NPCs (except for the [[Guild Thief]] and [[Guild Lord]]) advance to the center of the map, normally to the flag stand. At 25:00 the Guild Lord follows.

  * This skill was a [[shout]] before the [[Game updates/20070615|6/15/2007 game update]].
  
  
  
  {{bug|Currently, the VoD effect is bugged or simply mislabeled. Rather than increasing the damage players ''inflict'' by 25%, it actually just increases the damage ''taken'' by 25%.

  Verata is found near the Ascalon Foothills. You have to fight some Verata's Fiends and Verata's Horrors to get to him. When you see him, he will raise a Bone Fiend and walk away. Return to Yak's Bend to get your reward.\n\n\
  ==Dialogue==\n\
  <!-- Transcription of dialogue. -->\n\
  ===Initial dialogue===\n\
  '''Necromancer Morgan'''\n\
  :\"As you've no doubt heard, there have been a number of recent disappearances among the townsfolk. Thus far, we've assumed they fell victim to the Stone Summit or other local menaces. The truth, Grenth forgive us, is something much much worse. One of our Order, a promising Necromancer named Verata, has been experimenting with new ways to enhance and maintain summoned minions. Normally this would be a good thing, however, in his lust for power Verata has been kidnapping Ascalon citizens for use in his experiments! He was also spotted waylaying travelers coming up into the mountains from Ascalon. We must stop him, quickly and discreetly, before anyone can link the disappearances with our Order. Can you be of help in this situation?\" ''\n\n\

  ===Intermediate dialogue===\n\

  '''Verata the Necromancer'''\n\
  :''\"\"Great progress... Now, my minions, you will live beyond your normal span.\" \n\
  \"Who interrupts my experiments? You are a dog sent by the Order to hound me, no doubt? You will regret crossing me whelp! You have not heard the last of me!\" \n\
  \"'\n\
  ===Reward dialogue===\n\
  '''Necromancer Morgan'''\n\
  :''\"\"Now that Verata knows that our Order is after him, he will be careful not to show his face. This was not the desired goal, but it is a result we can work with. you have done well under difficult circumstances, <name>. Just as it is quick to punish those who violate our rules, our Order always rewards the faithful.\" \n\
  \"''\n\n\
  ==Notes==\n\
  This quest can be done easily at the same time as Shiverpeak Stragglers or Oswalt's Epitaph. For Shiverpeak stragglers, you simply go a bit to the east, and can easily lead them back along the path you cleared. For Oswalt's epitaph, travel to the Ascalon Foothills where his headstone is located.\n\n\
  If you are a combination of Necromancer and Warrior, do this quest at the same time as Securing the Vale. Both will lead you to the area with Verata.\n\n\

  [[Droknar's Forge]] (commonly referred to as \"Droks\") is a town in the [[Southern Shiverpeaks]] region of [[Tyria]]. It is the only town in Tyria where [[max armor]] can be crafted for 1 {{plat}} per piece.\n\n\
  ==Description==\n\
  ''Long ago, when the tribes of [[Deldrimor]] were united under one banner, Droknar's Forge was the seat of the mighty Dwarven nation's power. Named for one of its most beloved kings, the Forge has never once been taken by an enemy nation.''\n\n\
  ==Getting there==\n\
  Droknar's Forge can be reached by one of two methods:\n\
  *Completing [[the Dragon's Lair]] mission (requires completion of the three Crystal Desert missions)\n\
  *The [[Droks run]] is the only way to reach Droks without first ascending. This run is less popular for obtaining max armor, which can now be crafted in [[Kaineng Center]] by means of completing [[Mhenlo's Request]] from [[Lion's Arch]] (assuming that the player has access to [[Guild Wars Factions|Factions]]). However, the run has regained popularity for players seeking:\n\
  **power-leveling\n\
  **access to Prophecies only skills and Elites (from other campaigns)\n\
  **to farm in [[Sorrow's Furnace]]\n\
  **to gain access to the [[Ring of Fire]]\n\n\

  [[Nika]]'s past is shrouded in nearly as much mystery as Nika herself, though [[Master Togo]] has learned a bit about her\xE2\x80\x94everyone knows the master of [[Shing Jea Monastery]]. She has also let slip to Master Togo, if not to [[Mhenlo]] and his friends, that she was born in [[Wajjun Bazaar]], a market district not far from one of the largest ports in [[Cantha]]. Her father died mysteriously before she was born; her mother sent Nika to the secretive [[Conclave]] at a very young age to learn the art of the [[Assassin]], a trade that the women of her family had practiced for centuries. Her mother, in fact, runs the largest Assassin's guild in all of Cantha. Nika killed her first man at age 10, and made her first solo kill when she was 12. She has never murdered anyone, to her way of thinking\xE2\x80\x94assassination is her business, and she kills only to defend herself or her friends, or to fulfill a licensed contract.\n\n\
  Nika joins Mhenlo's group almost by accident. She is impressed by the way the disparate group of heroes works so efficiently, and offers to fill a void left by a set of twin sisters that left the group earlier. She is wholly dedicated to only two things\xE2\x80\x94avenging her ancestor [[Vizu]] and protecting the [[Empire of the Dragon]].\n\n\

  }}\n\
  Firstborn son of [[King Adelbern]] and heir to the throne of [[Ascalon]], [[Prince Rurik]] is a brave, bold man who often takes action on the spur of the moment. He leads by example, never cowering or shirking a challenge. Some say he has no fear. Others claim his brash bravery is merely reckless. Regardless, the prince is liked by almost everyone in Ascalon, and he spends much of his time among the citizens, preferring the company of commoners to that of Ascalon\xE2\x80\x99s rich upper crust.\n\n\
  As a boy, Prince Rurik trained at the [[Ascalon Academy]] and did a stint as an officer in the army. Today, he maintains a fighting force of his own, known as the [[Ascalon Vanguard]]. These soldiers are completely independent of the king\xE2\x80\x99s financing and influence. King Adelbern, takes a certain amount of offense to this, though he keeps it to himself and his closest advisors. Though the prince is loyal to his father, he doesn\xE2\x80\x99t always agree with the man\xE2\x80\x99s methods or ideology.\n\n\
  {{spoiler|the [[Guild Wars Prophecies|Prophecies]] [[PvE]] campaign}}\n\
  Rurik lost his betrothed [[Lady Althea]] to the [[Charr]] invasion of Ascalon.\n\n\
  At the end of the [[Nolani Academy (mission)|Nolani Academy]] mission, an arguement causes King Adelbern to denounce Rurik as his son, and banishes him from Ascalon.\n\n\
  Following this, Rurik gathers up a group of his followers, including the players, and leads them on a journey over the [[Shiverpeak Mountains]] into the last standing human kingdom, [[Kryta]]. Unfortunately, while leading his people through [[The Frost Gate]], he stays behind to hold off the [[Stone Summit]], and is caught by [[Dagnar Stonepate]] and killed. The prince is not heard of for a great deal of time afterwards.\n\n\
  However, sometime between his death and the players' return to the Shiverpeaks, the evil [[Lich Lord]] finds Rurik's corpse and brings him back to serve him. In the final mission, [[Hell's Precipice (mission)|Hell's Precipice]], the players confront the undead prince who, while aware of who the players are, is bound to the Lich's will and must fight them. After a lengthy battle, [[Undead Prince Rurik]] is defeated, and his soul is given peace. \n\n\

  The Footman with only one attack skill and 480 health is a valuable but non valuable aspect in a game of [[GvG]]. Weak and easy to aggro, the footman is uaually one of the first [[NPC]]'s to be knocked off dead, and with little damage besides [[bleeding]] they are the least valuable in the GvG aspect of all [[NPC]]'s. In [[VoD]] they do however can take on the role as meat sheild and protect your other valuable [[NPC]]'s.

Blood And Smoke: "{{Quest infobox\n\

  | type = Skill\n\
  | given by = [[Deep Root]]\n\
  | given at = [[Ettin's Back]]\n\
  | preceded by = [[Dropping Eaves]]\n\
  }}\n\
  Concerned by news of a traitor in their midsts, Deep Root turns to an unorthodox source of information.  Players must journey deep into the heart of the Magumma Jungle to seek the council of the ancient tree Deep Root.  His council isn't free, though.  Players must obtain the bloody heart of a Centaur boss for it.\n\n\
  ==Quest information==\n\n\
  ===Objectives===\n\
  * Find [[Scout Melthoran]] in [[Reed Bog]].\n\
  * Find [[Dark Oak]] in [[The Falls|the Falls]] to the southwest.\n\
  * Slay [[Drogo Greatmane]].\n\
  * Return the bloody heart to Dark Oak.\n\
  * Return to Deep Root and tell him of Dark Oak's warning.\n\n\

  * {{n}}{{skill icon|Barbed Signet}}\n\
  * {{me}}{{skill icon|Spirit Shackles}}\n\
  * {{e}}{{skill icon|Meteor}}\n\n\
  ==Walkthrough==\n\
  On entry to [[Reed Bog]] from [[Ettin's Back]] talk to Scout Melthoran, then the party should take the left hand route heading south. This way, they can encounter and slay Drogo Greatmane before meeting Dark Oak, which can help speed up the quest immensely.  Otherwise you'd have to re-zone between The Falls and Reed Bog and re-fight all the enemies on the way.\n\n\
  There are a lot of poisoning spiders and rock throwing guardians on this quest, warriors might want to bring [[\"Shields Up!\"]], or monks bring [[Aegis]] to help defend the party and mitigate some damage.  [[Condition removal quick reference|Condition removal]] or [[Healing Breeze]] can also be helpful.\n\n\
  ==Dialogue==\n\n\
  ===Initial dialogue===\n\
  '''DeepRoot'''\n\
  :''\"All this talk of of traitors worries me.  Although I am loathe to do so, it may be time to turn to...alternate sources of information.  Deep within the forest lives Dark Oak.  He does not usually choose to show himself, but perhaps if our need is great he will make his presence known.  One of my scouts name '''Melthoran''', who is stationed in the '''Reed Bog''', knows where to find him.   We need someone to seek out Dark Oak and obtain his counsel.''\n\n\
  :''\"Will you undertake this task?\"''\n\
  :'''Accept:''' ''\"I will seek out Dark Oak.\"''\n\
  :'''Decline:''' ''\"I don't talk to trees.\"''\n\
  :'''When asked about quest:''' ''\"Speak with '''Scout Melthoran''' in the '''Reed Bog'''.  He should be able to Direct you to Dark Oak.\"''\n\n\
  ===Intermediate dialogue===\n\
  '''Scout Melthoran'''\n\
  :''\"You wish to Speak with Dark Oak?  You're a braver man than I.  When he deigns to show himself, he can be found to the southwest in the Falls.  Good Luck.\"''\n\n\
  '''Dark Oak'''\n\
  :''\"I sense no fear in your heart. That is good, for there is no reason to fear me. I am but an aspect of nature, just as decay and death are part of the natural cycle. I already know the question you wish to ask, and yes, I can consult certain...powers to obtain and answer, though it may not be to your liking. The powers I would consult require sacrifices. If you wish me to consult with them, you must seek out the mighty Centaur lord called Drogo Greatmane. Bring me this centaur's heart, and you shall have the answers you seek.\"''\n\n\
  '''Dark Oak'''\n\
  :''\"Let me look into the dark...  I see a great beast, a great cat...a lion.  This lion hungers.  He is devouring..the forest...the entire forest...  Nay, the entire world!  A host of gleaming angels...no not angels but birds...carrion birds...bright and terrible as the sun accompany this lion.  All falls before his hunger untill naught is left but bitter ashes.  That is all I see.\"''\n\n\
  ===Reward dialogue===\n\
  '''Deep Root'''\n\
  :''\"This is a dire vision indeed.  The lion he saw is obviously Kryta or the White Mantle but what of the carrion birds?   I must consult with Evennia.  Perhaps she can interpret this vision.  Thank you my friend for everything you have done for us.\"''\n\n\n\
  ==Notes==\n\
  {{spoiler|the [[Prophecies]] & [[Nightfall]] [[PvE]] campaigns}}\n\
  We later learn that events in Tyria are being manipulated by the servant of a dark, vengful god.  Dark Oak's vision may very well not be about Kryta and the White Mantle, but about [[Abbadon]].  He's definitely out to devour the world, and his \"hair\" does bear some resemblance to a lion's mane.  The gleaming angels/carrion birds could refer to [[Margonite|Margonites]]."

The players storm the temple, slaying the Afflicted and defeating [[Bound Kaolai]], as well as the bound forms of the others, freeing them from Shiro's grasp. He later can be revisited and spoken with.
  
  Following [[Master Togo]]'s death, Kaolai is replaced by him in the temple.
  
  ==Kaolai's Heroism==
  The plaque alongside his statue in the temple explains Kaolai's reason for induction into the temple:
  
  ''When the gods walked Tyria a thousand years ago, the Ritualist Kaolai, an old man even then, challenged Balthazar to a game of Nui in exchange for sparing a village that had offended the god through some long-forgotten breach of etiquette. Balthazar laughingly accepted and the game began. Seven days later it ended with Kaolai the winner; the villagers were spared. But in a fit of anger, Balthazar slew Kaolai. Afterward, in a rare gesture of sportsmanship, the god ordered Kaolai inducted into Tahnnakai Temple.''
  
  There is also a skill, [[Protective Was Kaolai]], named after him.

  == Walkthrough ==
  The mission objective is simply to defeat the Doppelganger. The bonus objective is to defeat the Doppelganger within 2 minutes.
  
  The Doppelganger is believed to have 12 in every attribute for your primary and secondary professions, however this has not been confirmed for all attributes. The Doppelganger's skill bar is identical to yours.
  
  === Strategies ===
  *The doppelganger will not queue skills, which means that you can [[spam]] a skill chain more quickly than the Doppelganger.
  *If you and the doppelganger both die at the same time, you will still get credit for completing the mission.  This will count as a death however, so avoid using this strategy if you are trying for the [[Survivor]] title.
  
  ==== Warrior ====
  *Bring [[Frenzy]], but do not use it. Instead, just attack the Doppelganger and let it use Frenzy.
  *Bring [[Wild Blow]] and a number of Adrenal Skills. Use only Adrenal Skills while letting the Doppelganger lose its adrenaline from Wild Blow.
  *Do not bring any healing skills such as [[Healing Signet]] only spammable melee attack skills, you should be able to attack faster and the doppelganger will not be able to heal.
  
  ==== Ranger ====
  *Bring an [[animal companion]] and use [[Pet Attack]]s. The Doppelganger will not bring a pet.
  *Bring a large number of [[Nature Ritual]]s. The Doppelganger will waste time activating the rituals which will help or harm both sides equally.
  *Bring several spammable attack skills. You should be able to activate them more quickly than the Doppelganger.
  *Move within melee distance of the Doppelganger.  He will change to a melee weapon for which he has no skills equiped.  Continue attacking the Doppelganger with bow attacks.
  *'''[Hard Mode]''' - Bring 5 Nature Rituals, Predatory Bond and Rampage as One, attack until dead. Using Predatory Bond if you feel that you need healing.
  *'''[Hard Mode]''' -  Bring a five [[Nature Ritual]]s, [[Troll Ungent]], an Area-of Effect skill, and [[Distracting Shot]]. The Doppelganger will waste time activating the rituals. Make sure to bring quickening zephyr so the nature rituals recharge quicker. On about the third nature ritual, the Doppelganger will use troll ungent. Use distracting shot on him at that moment. When all five nature rituals are done, the Doppelganger will use the Area-of-Effect skill. Just move out of the way. After this use your Area-of Effect skill (it may be interupted)(the Doppelganger and his rituals should be in the same place). This will destroy his nature rituals so he has to make new ones. Heal when you need to, just countinue attacking him until he is dead.
  
  ==== Monk ====
  *Bring [[Blessed Aura]], [[Divine Boon]], [[Life Attunement]], [[Holy Veil]] and four damaging skills from [[Smiting Prayers]]. Use only the Smiting Prayers skills, while the Doppelganger wastes its energy on maintained enchantments it cannot benefit from.
  *The Doppelganger will only use the spell [[Healing Breeze]] to counter health degen not health loss. Bring this as the only healing skill.
  *'''[Hard Mode]''' - Put 12 attribute points into smiting. Only bring [[Retribution]], [[Holy Wrath]] and [[Shield of Judgment]]. Precast Retribution and Holy Wrath before entering. As soon as you enter cast Shield of Judgement. The doppelganger will attack you on long range killing himself before Shield of Judgment runs out.
  
  ==== Necromancer ====
  *Bring [[Awaken the Blood]], [[Dark Fury]], [[Dark Pact]], [[Defile Flesh]], [[Order of Pain]], [[Order of the Vampire]], [[Signet of Agony]], [[Touch of Agony]]. Don't use any skills.
  *Bring [[Insidious Parasite]] max out curse at 12.  Cast and Don't attack.
  *'''[Hard Mode]''' - Use [[Spoil Victor]] and let him attack you.  Use [[Insidious Parasite]] to slow the damage down if you are worried.
  *'''[Hard Mode]''' - Bring [[Insidious Parasite]] and [[Spiteful Spirit]] max out curse at 12.  Cast both and Don't attack.
  
  ==== Mesmer ====
  *Bring [[Chaos Storm]], [[Clumsiness]], [[Drain Enchantment]], [[Empathy]], [[Illusion of Haste]], [[Illusion of Weakness]] and [[Shatter Enchantment]]. Don't attack or use enchantments, use Clumsiness and Empathy, use Shatter Enchantment or Drain Enchantment whenever the Doppelganger becomes enchanted, use [[Chaos Storm]] when the Doppelganger becomes crippled after losing Illusion of Haste.
  *Bring [[Empathy]], [[Spirit Shackles]], [[Sympathetic Visage]] and [[Wastrel's Worry]], don't attack, use Spirit Shackles, Sympathetic Visage and Empathy immediately, spam Wastrel's Worry.
  *A simpler but equally effective variant of the above is to simply bring Backfire and Wastrel's Worry. Cast Backfire on the Doppelganger at the start of the battle. Attack the Doppelganger normally, refraining from usage of any skills. The Doppelganger will spam Wastrel's Worry, and kill itself quite quickly.
  *For Mesmers who have taken Elementalist as their secondary profession, take [[Fire Attunement]], [[Air Attunement]], [[Water Attunement]], [[Earth Attunement]], two other enchantment spells of your choice, [[Shatter Enchantment]] and [[Backfire]].  Place Shatter Enchantment in slot 7, and Backfire in slot 8.  When the battle starts, the Doppelganger will prioritise spells from left to right, allowing you to cast Backfire while it is still casting enchantments on itself.  The Doppelganger will fall quite quickly under the damage caused by Backfire, and Shatter Enchantment will also allow you to deal some extra damage.  After casting Shatter Enchantment, the Doppelganger may try to cast Backfire on you, so it is often best to wait until the Doppelganger is starting to run low on health before casting Shatter Enchantment.
  
  ==== Elementalist ====
  *Bring [[Meteor Shower]], [[Fire Storm]], [[Lava Font]], [[Searing Heat]], [[Fire Attunement]] and three non-[[ADoT]] Fire Magic skills such as [[Flare]]. Use Fire Attunement before triggering the cinematic, then spam the non-ADoT skills. When the Doppelganger finishes casting Meteor Shower, run out of its range then cast Meteor Shower, Fire Storm and Searing Heat, then run up and cast Lava Font and go back to spamming the non-ADoT skills.
  *Another option is to bring [[Glyph of Essence]], [[Fire Attunement]], [[Meteor Shower]], and [[Searing Flames]]. Cast Fire Attunement before the cinematic. The Doppleganger will use Glyph of Essence to cast Meteor Shower, or if you're really lucky, Fire Attunement, thus depleting all of its Energy. Move out of the way of Meteor Shower if it's cast and start spamming Searing Flames. With zero energy, there's very little it can do to you and it should go down quickly. 
  * For Elementalists who have selected Mesmer as their secondary, bring [[Empathy]] and [[Blinding Flash]]. Hex the Doppelganger with Empathy and keep it blinded with Blinding Flash. It will kill itself while doing virtually no damage to you.
  
  
  '''''Hard mode description only works for E/Mo'''''
  *'''Hard Mode''' bring [[Meteor Shower]], [[Fire Storm]], [[Lava Font]], [[Searing Flames]], [[Flare]], [[Glyph of Essence]], and [[Judge's Intervention]].  Use Fire attunement before triggering the cinematic, Quickly cast Meteor Shower (note, he may cast different spells, but its the same process), run to him, and cast lava font, cast Judge's Intevention and then Fire Storm on him.  Then just spam Searing Flames and Flare, back to back, He should die fairly easy.
  
  ==== Assassin ====
  *Bring [[Unsuspecting Strike]], [[Wild Strike]], [[Horns of the Ox]], [[Falling Spider]], [[Critical Strike]] and [[Desperate Strike]]. Activate the skills in order. If you have 30+ energy, you can replace Critical Strike with [[Twisting Fangs]]. Using [[Critical Eye]] in advance also helps with energy.
  *Bring [[Shadow Form]] as your only skill but do not use it. Wait for them to use it then finish them off easily.
  
  ==== Ritualist ====
  *Bring [[Anguished Was Lingwah]], [[Dissonance]], [[Shadowsong]], [[Painful Bond]], [[Brutal Weapon]], [[Earthbind]], [[Shelter]] and [[Union]]. Cast Anguished Was Linwah before the cinematic. After the cinematic, drop the ashes, cast Dissonance, Shadowsong, Painful Bond and Brutal Weapon, then start attacking the Doppelganger. Dissonance should prevent the Doppelganger from summoning spirits, and Earthbind, Shelter and Union should waste the Doppelganger's time.
  *Bring only [[Vengeful Weapon]], get within melee range of the Doppelganger and spam Vengeful Weapon on yourself without attacking. The Doppelganger will kill itself attacking you. (This also works as a secondary Ritualist)
  
  ==== Paragon ====
  *Bring nothing but [[Anthem]]s (excluding [[Defensive Anthem]]), [[Aria]]s and [[Lyric]]s. Don't use any skills, just attack the Doppelganger.
  
  ==== Dervish ====
  *Bring spammable [[Scythe Attack]]s. You should be able to use them more quickly than the Doppelganger.
  *Bring no skills and just attack.  You deal more damage than his axe most of the time.

  ==Dialogue==\n\
  ===Initial dialogue===\n\
  '''Deras Tenderlin'''\n\
  :''\"Sunspear! I have a great favor to ask of you. Our home has suffered relentless attacks from vicious hordes of undead, and I have been sent to recruit any who can help us defeat this foe. The Sunspears are renowned across the world for their bravery, skill in battle, and selfless nature. I beg of you to consider leaving Elona to help us in our time of need. '''Mhenlo''', another emissary from the lands to the north, can further apprise you of the situation if you're willing to help us. He is at the '''Consulate Docks'''.\"''\n\n\
  :'''Accept''': ''\"I'll go speak to Mhenlo at the Consulate Docks.\"''\n\
  :'''Reject''': ''\"I'm a bit busy at the moment with matters important to the Sunspears.\"''\n\

  ===Intermediate dialogue===\n\
  '''Intermediate Dialogue 1 (Mhenlo)'''\n\
  :''\"I have much to tell you about the situation in the distant kingdom of Ascalon... my home. Ascalon, in the lands of Tyria, was once a thriving kingdom... until the day the armies of the Charr attacked.''\n\n\
  :''On that horrible day, they invoked a fearsome magic that destroyed Ascalon City and left most of the kingdom in ruins... an event we called the Searing. While some people remained in Ascalon with King Adelbern to defend the kingdom against the Charr, many more joined his son, Prince Rurik.\"''\n\
  ::'''Player Response''': ''\"Tell me more about the situation in Tyria.\"''\n\n\
  '''Intermediate Dialogue 2 (Mhenlo)'''\n\
  :''\"Rurik left our homeland and crossed the treacherous Shiverpeak Mountains, home of the Dwarves, to reach the lands of Kryta. Although he did not survive the journey, Rurik's courage and sacrifice enabled our people to find a new home near Lion's Arch. However a new danger threatens all of Kryta, including the Ascalon refugees.''\n\n\
  :''Soon I shall return home to answer the call and deal with that threat. Once you have completed your tasks here in Elona and are ready to help me and the people of Tyria, let me know.\"''\n\
  ::'''Player Response''': ''\"I wish to travel to Tyria.\"''\n\n\
  '''Intermediate Dialogue 3 (Mhenlo)'''\n\
  :''\"If you have completed your business here in Elona and are ready to travel to Tyria, I have a ship prepared to carry us there immediately. Are you ready to travel to Tyria?\"''\n\n\
  '''Intermediate Dialogue 4 (Lionguard Neiro)'''\n\
  :''\"Greetings, <name>. Mhenlo told me of your arrival. I am happy to see you have made it safely to Kryta. Our lands are in dire need of heroes. If you're half as good as Mhenlo claims, your efforts will be most welcome, indeed.''\n\n\
  :''In addition to the undead threat, I should appraise you of another situation.\"''\n\
  ::'''Player Response''': ''\"Tell me more about this new situation in Kryta.\"''\n\n\
  '''Intermediate Dialogue 5 (Lionguard Neiro)'''\n\
  :''\"For as long as Lion's Arch has existed, it has been the duty of the Lionguard to defend the city and the people of Kryta. Recently, a new group, a religious cult known as the White Mantle, has gained power in our lands... some say too much power.''\n\n\
  :''Worse, the royal family has gone missing, and the White Mantle has assumed leadership over Kryta. As of now, the Lionguard still controls the city, but the countryside beyond Lion's Arch is now held and protected by the White Mantle.\"''\n\
  ::'''Player Response''': ''\"Tell me more about the White Mantle.\"''\n\n\
  '''Intermediate Dialogue 6 (Lionguard Neiro)'''\n\
  :''\"So far they seem to be doing a good job of protecting the countryside. But I've learned to be wary of those who seek to change old ways, and these White Mantle claim to have discovered a whole new pantheon of unseen gods... What could be a bigger change than new gods?''\n\n\
  :''I suggest you work with them to try and stop this undead threat, but keep one eye on them at the same time. They seem a little too good to be true, if you take my meaning.\"''\n\n\
  ===Reward dialogue===\n\
  '''Firstwatch Sergio'''\n\
  :''\"Welcome to Lion's Arch. I am Firstwatch Sergio, commander of the Lionguard. I believe you have arrived just in time. The massive undead siege continues unabated. The White Mantle claim they can protect the people, but honestly... I fear they will protect only their own interests.

In return for your efforts, I will grant you full traveling privileges within the city and beyond.\"''"

Karei: |-
  {{npc-stub}}
  {{NPC infobox
  | species = Ghost
  | profession = Monk
  | level = 20
  | campaign = Factions
  }}
  [[Karei]] is one of several [[Canthan Heroes]]. Like the others, his spirit dwells in [[Tahnnakai Temple]], giving advice to those who seek it.
  
  {{spoiler|the [[Guild Wars Factions|Factions]] [[PvE]] campaign}}
  During [[Shiro Tagachi]]'s return, he and his army of [[Afflicted]] claim the temple, and traps Karei and the other spirits within [[Spirit Binder]]s, transforming them into bound spirits. The players storm the temple, slaying the Afflicted and defeating [[Bound Karei]], as well as the bound forms of the others, freeing them from Shiro's grasp. He later can be revisited and spoken with.
  
  ==Karei's Heroism==
  The plaque alongside his statue in the temple explains Karei's reason for induction into the temple:
  
  ''Karei was a powerful healer who lived seven hundred years ago. For most of his life, he tended a small village in northern Cantha, curing ills and setting broken bones, refusing pay and accepting only food and basic supplies from the community. One day a wealthy Canthan noble and his small entourage passed by Karei's village and were attacked by bandits in the nearby woods. The noble suffered a grievous wound, and after killing the bandits, his guards brought him to Karei, who healed him easily. When the wealthy man attempted to pay him in gold, the Monk refused. Next the noble offered Karei employment on his lavish estate; again the Monk refused. Finally, the noble offered to give the Monk great powers that would make him a god among men, but Karei would not be moved. Smiling, the noble stood and let his cloak fall away, and as he did, he was transformed into a beautiful woman. The goddess Dwayna herself stood before Karei and placed a hand upon his head. "Thrice I have tempted you and thrice you have resisted. I choose you." Called by his goddess, Karei could not refuse his new appointment as Master of the Kaziin Monastery, where he lived out his days training young Monks and healing any sick or broken who came his way. Upon his death, Dwayna herself inducted him into Tahnnakai.''
  
  There is also a skill, [[Karei's Healing Circle]], named after him.
  
  ==Notes==
  *Strangely, Karei appears in his spirit form as what appears to be an [[Ascalon|Ascalonian]]. The plaque claims he had grown up in Cantha, however. Either he moved to Cantha at an early age, or this is an oversight.

  Just on the edge of the Ring of Fire, the Ember Light Camp was established by a group of sailors whose corsair was shipwrecked here during a terrible storm. There is little left today of the original camp except the story of the men who lived to tell the tale.
  
  ==Notes==
  Ember Light Camp is the only [[outpost]] in the [[Ring of Fire]] island chain. Players arrive here after completing the [[Thunderhead Keep (Mission)|Thunderhead Keep mission]]. From Ember Light Camp players must exit into [[Perdition Rock]] to complete the quest [[Final Blow]] in order to advance to the next mission area. Perdition Rock also has many [[Elite skill]]s which can be [[Signet of Capture|captured]] from enemy bosses in the area.

  There are some who say that the demonic, savage [[Oni]] originate in [[the Mists]], others from someplace even more distant, dark, and cut off from the world of sanity. They are killers from beyond, appearing from nowhere to butcher their victims, for what reason no one knows. Whatever their purpose or origin, the Oni are among the most deadliest things on two legs in [[Cantha]].

  ==Notes==
  The [[Turtle Clan]], as explained by [[Dauv Merishahl]], believe that the Oni are [[Outcast]]s in an advanced state of corruption caused by [[Kanaxai]].
  
  Incidents have been reported in [[Rhea's Crater]] where 5 Oni spawn, run out across the bridge and make eerie beckoning gestures to the player. When the player gets onto the bridge, 5 more Oni spawn behind them and the player is torn to pieces between the inescapable onslaught of the Oni groups. It is unknown if this incident is repeated elsewhere in the game.
  
  ==Trivia==
  In Japanese folklore, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oni_(folklore) oni] are invisible spirits or gods that cause disasters and have a taste for human flesh.
