# gw1builds

Guild Wars is an MMO with a rich skill and attribute system that lends itself
to complex single and multiplayer builds. However, it is difficult to design
builds within the game itself, especially for team builds. There is also no
way to easily save and share team builds with others once they've been created.

This is a tool for designing individual and team builds for Guild Wars (not
Guild Wars 2). It is an old Ruby on Rails application written circa 2006 that
is being converted/refactored/rewritten into a static website that only allows
builds to be stored locally.
